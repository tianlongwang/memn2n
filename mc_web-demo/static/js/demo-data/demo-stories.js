good-bye to his friends and walked over to the senior center.\n\"Hello, Billy.\nHow was school today?\" asked Curtis, when Billy came in.\nCurtis was the building\'s security guard.\n\"Hello.\nCurtis.\nSchool was okay,\" Billy said.\nEvery day at the senior center started like that.\nBilly would then go to the nurse\'s station where there was a quiet room.\nHe would do his homework, then sit and stare at the walls.\nBilly would try to look as bored and as miserable as possible, in the hope someone would notice and convince his mother to let him go home.\nHe would sit

want to get in trouble.\nSo he sat and tried to remember the way out.\nHe heard something coming from the door nearest him.\n\"Oh, for goodness\' sake, Henry,\" said a woman.\n\"You don\'t look anything like a Knight of the Realm.\nYou look more like an elephant.\"\n\"An elephant!\nIfl look like an elephant, you look like a peacock,\" a man\'s voice replied.\n\"They must be residents,\"

hope we\'re a million years late, and by the time we get to the music school, piano doesn\'t even exist anymore.\nThe people of the future will be smart.\nThey\'ll understand that mankind is better off without the piano.\nThey\'ll understand me.\"\n\"Okay, sweetheart.\nThat\'s great.\nPlease get in the car.\"\n\"No.\nOn no account.\nThis is America, Dad.\nDidn\'t you hear?\nNobody can make anybody play piano against her will.\nIt\'s called democracy.\"\n\"Angela?\nIf you don\'t get in that car right now, your mother is going to be very angry at me.\nAnd if she\'s angry at me, I\'m going to forbid you from using the computer.\"\n\"For how long?\"\n\"Until Christmas.\"\nDad wasn\'t joking.\nAngela got in the car.\nAs they drove, beads of sweat formed on the back of her neck, and her stomach started to feel like she had just swallowed a hockey puck.\nPracticing piano scared her to death.\nHer teacher, Mr. Poliakoff, was a hairy old man who talked with a lisp that made him nearly impossible to understand.\nShe could never tell if he was saying, \"I see,\" or calling for a \"high C.\" Uncertainty made Angela nervous, and nerves made it impossible for her to play.\nNot that Angela wanted to play anyway.\nShe thought that there was no music on Earth more boring than Mr. Poliakoff\'s sheet music.\nFor three months, she had gone once a week to learn famous compositions like \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,\" \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat,\" and \"Three Blind Mice.\"\nAs boring as those songs were, they were apparently impossible to play.\nEach time Angela picked up her fingers she was seized by fear.\nWhat if she played the wrong note?\nWould Mr. Poliakoff shout at her?\nOr, worse, would he simply shake his head in disappointment?\n\"Fear is the enemy of success,\" he would tell her, except that when he said it, it sounded more like \"sushshesh.\"\nBut when it came to the piano, fear was all Angela had.\n\"Timbuktu,\" she said.\nHer dad looked away from the road to give her a funny look.\nShe went on.\n\"Antarctica.\nThe Yukon.\nKazakhstan.\nBorneo.\nTasmania.\"\n\"Yes?\" asked her father, finally.\n\"I\'m trying to think of places I\'d like less than piano class.\"\n\"Did you come up with anything?\"\n\"Nope.\nEven the middle of the Amazon rainforest would be more fun.\"\n\"Well, I\'m glad you\'ve been studying your geography, at least.\"\nWhen her father looked away, Angela stuck out her tongue.\nThat would show him.\nAs usual, Mr. Poliakoff\'s music school smelled like cabbage.\nAngela did not know where he might be cooking the foul vegetable, but she was certain she didn\'t want to find out.\nShe trudged down the darkened hallway like her feet were made of rocks, glad her father wasn\'t there to tell her she was going to be late.\n\"Not that he cares anyway,\" she thought.\n\"He\'s done his job, dropping me off at the building.\nHe doesn\'t even care if I actually make it to class.\"\nAngela\'s eyes went wide.\nShe had an idea.\nShe pressed her back against the wall and slinked away from Mr. Poliakoff\'s classroom.\nShe would have to spend an hour in the music school, but that didn\'t mean she had to learn any music.\nShe tip-toed down the dark corridor, fearful that her piano teacher might burst out at any moment and bellow, \"You!\nCome here and practice \'Ring Around the Rosie!\'\"\nBut the door did not open.\nMr. Poliakoff did not catch her.\nAngela was free.\nShe was sneaking her way to the front door of the music school, planning on passing the hour in the sun, beneath a tree or on a bench, when she heard a funny sound.\nIt sounded like someone playing the piano, scales, but it sounded different than what she was used to.\nIt sounded like the person playing was having fun.\nShe followed the sound.\nIt was coming from one of the classrooms.\nShe peered through the glass window and saw that the piano bench was empty.\nFeeling sneaky, she turned the handle and padded into the empty classroom.\nThe music was coming from a computer in the corner.\nShe walked towards it, dying to find out what it was, when she learned the room wasn\'t as empty as she had thought.\n\"Hello?\" said a voice that stopped Angela\'s heart.\nIt came from a woman with long, gray hair and a mouth that twisted up a little bit at the sides.\n\"Can I help you?\"\n\"No,\" stammered Angela.\n\"I, uh, Ijust heard the music, and, \" \"Do you like the piano?\"\n\"I hate the piano,\" said Angela.\nThe woman started to laugh.\n\"Well!\" she said.\n\"That\'s too bad for you, since you\'re in a music school.\"\n\"No kidding.\"\n\"I\'m Mrs.\nO\'Hara.\"\n\"That\'s nice.\nI should be going.\"\n\"Hold on, hold on.\nYou wanted to know about this music?\"\nAngela was silent.\n\"Come on.\nIt\'s okay to be curious.\nDo you know anything about jazz?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Well, here it is.\"\nShe turned up the volume.\nThe man playing piano tapped at the keys like a baby hitting something with a hammer.\nHe sang like a clown, making strange noises and putting on all sorts of funny voices.\nThe words he sang were even stranger: All that meat and no potatoes All that food to the alligators, yes.\nHold me steady.\nI am ready For all that meat and no potatoes.\n\"It sounds so silly!\"\n\"Well, that\'s Fats,\" said Mrs. O\'Hara.\n\"Who\'s Fats?\"\n\"Fats Waller.\nThe piano player.\nHe\'s the one who wrote the song.\"\n\"A grown-up wrote this song?\"\n\"A very talented grown-up.\nDon\'t think about the silly words.\nListen to the piano.\nWhat does it sound like?\"\n\"It sounds crazy.\"\n\"It\'s all over the place, isn\'t it?\"\nMrs. O\'Hara was right.\nNone of his notes were where Angela was taught they were supposed to be.\nHe played fast when he should have played slowly; he played slowly when he should have played fast.\nIn between lines, he would shout nonsense like, \"Oh, stop it, Thomas!\nYou\'re tickling early!\"\nCrazy was the only word for it.\n\"Who\'s Thomas?\" asked Angela.\n\"I don\'t know.\"\n\"Huh.\nWell, I guess I should get going.\"\n\"You\'re supposed to be in class, aren\'t you?\nWith Mr.\nPoliakoff?\"\nAngela made a face.\n\"You\'re going to make me go back to class, aren\'t you?\"\n\"I\'m going to make you learn a little piano,\" said Mrs. O\'Hara.\n\"Because that\'s what your parents paid for.\"\n\"Can I play a song like this?\"\n\"Not quite yet.\nFats Waller spent a lot of time learning to play normal piano before he could start playing it crazy.\"\n\"He played \'Ring Around the Rosie?\'\"\n\"And \'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,\' and \'Three Blind Mice,\' and all of Mr. Poliakoff\'s favorites.\"\n\"But ifI learn to play those...eventually I can play this?\"\n\"You got it,\" said Mrs. O\'Hara, as she sat down beside the bench.\nAngela put her fingers on the keys and prepared to play.\nHer fingers weren\'t afraid any more.
