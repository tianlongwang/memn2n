Cortes Bank is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and about 100 miles from any land. The west coast is home to many large waves. Cortes Bank is the site of some of the largest and fastest waves in the world. The bank is a rugged, rocky, undersea ridge about 100 miles west of San Diego, California. In some places, the ridge is only 3 feet below the ocean's surface. Strong winds from winter storms sweep across the ocean's surface. The winds push the water, causing huge waves to form when the water rushes over Cortes Bank. Because there is no land to slow the water after the bank, the waves stay large. According to weather experts, Cortes Bank produces waves that are more than 70 feet high. That's as tall as a seven, story building! Some waves move at more than 30 miles per hour. Cortes Bank is considered one of the hardest places to surf in the world.",
