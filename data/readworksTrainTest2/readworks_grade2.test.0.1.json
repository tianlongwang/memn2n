        "text": " \"You\u0027re like the kitten in the litter that wakes up before all the others.\" Dad opened one eye and looked at me. I leaned in and licked his nose. \"Argh! I thought you were going to give me a kiss on the cheek!\" he said. I wiggled under the sheets. \"No, Dad! I\u0027m a kitten, remember? You just said.\" \"That isn\u0027t quite what I meant,\" Dad said. He hugged me under the covers and asked what I wanted for breakfast. \"Since you\u0027re up so early, we may as well eat!\" \"I want pancakes,\" I told Dad, as he lifted me from the bed and set me down onto the floor. \"Pancakes, eh? That\u0027s a big job for just one dad to take on,\" he said, spreading the quilt flat over the bed. \"I am going to need some help.\" At that, I stood still in my red pajamas with the train cars on them. Help Dad cook? Use the stove? I had gotten burned on the stove before, yanking the handle on a pan of bacon and splashing some grease onto my fingers. Suddenly I couldn\u0027t move. I wiggled my toes just to make sure I hadn\u0027t turned to stone. \"Mew,\" I said. Dad seemed to notice that I was scared. \"It\u0027s okay, Jack. I\u0027ll help you, you know! But I can\u0027t do it all alone if we\u0027re going to make enough pancakes for a hungry kitten and also his dad!\" He took my hand, and we walked downstairs together. In the kitchen, Dad took out ingredients from the pantry: flour, sugar, baking powder, and oil. Dad said, \"Can you get me the milk and one egg?\" I opened the fridge and handed him the carton of milk. I tried to give him an egg, but I dropped it onto the floor. \"Never mind, kiddo. It\u0027s no big deal,\" Dad said, handing me a rag to wipe up the yolk. I got another egg and cracked it into the mixing bowl. Then I helped whisk the batter together while Dad heated up some oil in a skillet. I stood on my little footstool when he poured the first ladleful of pancake batter into the pan. \"Ready to flip it, Champ?\" \"Dad! No! That\u0027s the scariest part! I got burned the last time I touched a pan!\" \"Well, you won\u0027t ever get over it if you don\u0027t try again, will you? And this happens to be the part of the pancake-making process where I need the most help.\" Little bubbles began to appear in the middle of the pancake batter in the pan. The edge of the pancake was turning brown. Dad handed me a spatula, and I squeezed the handle while I stared at the pancake, about to burn unless I acted fast. My stomach felt like it was full of little birds flapping around, and I remembered the blister I got from the bacon grease burn. And then, with one hand, I gripped the handle of the skillet. \"I\u0027m a chef!\" I shouted, flipping the pancake over with a slap and a sizzle as the uncooked side hit the pan. \"You did it!\" Dad gave me a high-five. \"You want to do the rest of them?\" \"No,\" I said. I hopped from my stool and ran to set the table. "

        "author": "This article is provided courtesy of the American Museum of Natural History",
        "text": "On a spring night in 2007, disaster struck a small town in Kansas called Greensburg. Shortly before 10 p.m., a siren went off. A mile-wide tornado was approaching Greensburg. Its winds were estimated to be more than 200 miles per hour. In less than ten minutes, the town was destroyed. Ten people lost their lives. When the storm had passed, people climbed out from their storm cellars through the rubble. Cars and trucks had been thrown about. Homes were crushed, or simply ripped from the ground. \"I\u0027m in downtown Greensburg. There\u0027s really nothing left,\" said one resident. How do tornadoes form? A tornado is a swirling,  funnel-shaped  column of wind. It starts with a thunderstorm. Thunderclouds form when warm, wet air collides with cool, dry air. Then, strong winds form a wide tube of spinning air. When the tube touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.Kansans are used to tornadoes. The people of Greensburg live smack in the middle of \"Tornado Alley.\" It is an area that spans eight states in the central United States. This region has just what tornadoes need to get started: cool, dry air from the Arctic mixing with warm, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico. There is a lot of wide open space, called the Great Plains, for tornadoes to form. These conditions give rise to more than 600 tornadoes, on average, in \"Tornado Alley\" every year.How do scientists predict dangerous storms? Meteorologists are scientists who study and forecast weather. They use a technology called radar to track storms, including tornadoes. Radar gives them information about how far away the tornado is and how fast it is moving. Although tornadoes have fast swirling winds, tornadoes themselves move relatively slowly (18 to 30 miles per hour). So their paths can be predicted with reasonable confidence. A system of tornado watches and warnings is used to alert the public to danger. A tornado \"watch\" means thunderstorm conditions exist that could set off a tornado. A \"warning\" means a tornado has touched down and been spotted. This system saved many lives in Greensburg. After the tornado sirens shrieked, people had 20 minutes to escape to their basements and storm shelters before the tornado destroyed their town."

        "text": "The ground starts to shake. Buildings begin to sway. Watch out, here comes an earthquake! Earthquakes are natural events. They usually happen very quickly. In fact, most earthquakes last less than thirty seconds. You may be surprised to hear that earthquakes are not rare. In fact, earthquakes happen every day somewhere in the world. Most of them are weak. There are times, however, when an earthquake is very powerful and causes a lot of damage. One strong earthquake can destroy houses, bridges, railroad tracks, and more. Earthquakes are caused by the movement of huge pieces of rock under Earth\u0027s surface. The pieces are called tectonic plates. These plates are found in the top layers of Earth, called the crust and the upper mantle. Tectonic plates have rough edges and are always moving. Usually, they move slowly. But there are times when the plates get stuck against each other. If that happens, pressure builds up. When the two plates finally get \"unstuck,\" they release energy. Often, a small amount of energy is released. That will mean a small earthquake. However, sometimes a lot of energy is released. When that happens, the earthquake that follows will be strong...and dangerous! "

One day after school, Emily asks Morgan if they can play soccer together. \"Of course!\" says Morgan. \"I will teach you! The two girls go home and change into comfy clothes. Emily puts on purple shorts, and Morgan puts on her soccerjersey. Then, Morgan puts on her soccer cleats, special shoes for soccer. They have spikes on the bottom so soccer players don\u0027t slip on the grass. \"You can wear sneakers,\" Morgan tells Emily. \"Just make sure to tie your laces tight!\" They run out their front door. Morgan is carrying a soccer ball. \"Be careful, girls!\" their mother calls out. Both sisters smile and hold up a thumbs-up sign. \"First, we can pass the ball to each other,\" Morgan says. She drops the ball on the soft, green grass. She lifts her right foot and kicks the ball towards Emily. It flies past Emily and zooms into their neighbor\u0027s front yard. \"You kicked it too hard!\" Emily shouts. Morgan giggles and says sorry. She runs into the yard to get the ball back. \"Okay, I\u0027ll try again,\" Morgan says. This time, she kicks it more softly. Her foot pushes it straight to Emily. Emily holds out her foot to stop the ball. \"Perfect!\" Emily says, excited. \"Now kick it back!\" Morgan shouts. Emily lifts her foot and kicks the ball. But instead of going to Morgan, the ball flies to the left, near the garage. Emily is sad. \"Why didn\u0027t the ball go straight to you?\" she asks her sister. \"Don\u0027t be sad!\" Morgan says. \"You have to aim.\" She tells Emily that she can change the direction of the ball with her feet. She can push the ball towards the right or left. She can also stop the ball by blocking it with her foot. That way, players of the same team can pass the ball to each other and eventually shoot the ball into the goal. Morgan says it takes a lot of practice to become good at soccer. \"Don\u0027t worry. We\u0027ll try again tomorrow,\" Morgan tells Emily. Their mom opens the front door. \"Dinner, girls!\" she calls out. Morgan picks up the ball, and they both run inside. Emily is tired, but she\u0027s excited to learn more tomorrow! "

She held the pencil and used the ruler to draw a straight line. Then her father marked a small line across the longer line at the left end. Above the small line, he wrote, Lily is born. \"Why did you make that small line at the left end, Dad?\" Lily asked. \"On a time line, events are ordered from left to right. The first event is placed on the left end and the last event is placed on the right end.\" Lily then wrote the month, day, and year of her birthday under the first small line. Next, her dad marked another small line to the right of the first small line. He wrote, Lily learns to walk above that line. Then he marked another small line to the right of the second small line. Above this line he wrote, Lily starts school. \"What about when I learned to ride my bike?\" asked Lily. \"Right! We should add that,\" her dad said. \"I want to add pictures,\" Lily told her dad. She made a drawing of herself riding a bike and taped it to the paper. Her dad put a photo of Lily\u0027s first day of school on the time line, too. Now their work was done. Lily said, \"That time line is a picture of my life.\" \"It is a picture of your life sofar,\" her dad added. \"There is a lot more to come!\" "

        "text": "\"But I don\u0027t want to go there!\" insisted Billy. He kicked at the ground with his foot, twisted his body around, and looked up at his mother with tears in his eyes. Billy was angry. His mother was a nurse, and she had a new job at a senior center. \"Old-folks home,\" Billy called it. \"Senior Center,\" his mother corrected. Billy didn\u0027t like the seniors. He didn\u0027t like the senior center. He thought it was boring. Billy\u0027s mother wanted Billy to come to the senior center every day after school. Billy wanted to go to see his friends or play video games at home. Billy\u0027s mother wouldn\u0027t let him. \"I don\u0027t have a babysitter for you,\" she said. \"And you can\u0027t go to a friend\u0027s house unsupervised every day.\" The senior center was across the street from Billy\u0027s school. \"Come meet me at the center at 3pm,\" his mother directed. \"You can stay here until my shift ends at 4:30.\" So it was decided. Every day after school Billy said good-bye to his friends and walked over to the senior center. \"Hello, Billy. How was school today?\" asked Curtis, when Billy came in. Curtis was the building\u0027s security guard. \"Hello. Curtis. School was okay,\" Billy said. Every day at the senior center started like that. Billy would then go to the nurse\u0027s station where there was a quiet room. He would do his homework, then sit and stare at the walls. Billy would try to look as bored and as miserable as possible, in the hope someone would notice and convince his mother to let him go home. He would sit and think of his friends, home playing video games. He thought ofthe worlds he could be creating and the monsters he could be slaying. If only he were playing video games, too. Billy\u0027s mother didn\u0027t appreciate any of this. \"You\u0027re being ridiculous,\" she said. \"Why are you acting this way? The senior center isn\u0027t torture. There\u0027s a lot you could do here. I don\u0027t understand why you\u0027re being so dramatic,\" said Billy\u0027s mother, exasperated. \"Why don\u0027t you help me or Curtis?\" \"No, thanks,\" said Billy, who would go right back to looking miserable. After a few days of this routine Billy did start to get bored. His plan wasn\u0027t working. His mother wasn\u0027t giving in. Billy was going to have to get to like the senior center. The next day after school Billy went to the senior center. He said hello to Curtis and went to the nurse\u0027s station. He did his homework. This time, for a change, when Billy finished his homework, he decided to go exploring. Billy left the nurse\u0027s station and turned right down the hallway. He had never seen the rest of the facility. The building was huge. Every hallway looked the same. Billy followed the hallway until it came to another hallway. After a while, Billy was lost. Billy sat down in the hallway and tried to remember the way back. He didn\u0027t want to ask directions. He wasn\u0027t supposed to be there. He didn\u0027t want to get in trouble. So he sat and tried to remember the way out. He heard something coming from the door nearest him. \"Oh, for goodness\u0027 sake, Henry,\" said a woman. \"You don\u0027t look anything like a Knight of the Realm. You look more like an elephant.\" \"An elephant! Ifl look like an elephant, you look like a peacock,\" a man\u0027s voice replied. \"They must be residents,\" thought Billy. Curious, he crawled over and peeked inside the room. He saw something he had not expected. The woman who was speaking had on a pink track suit and an even pinker feather boa around her shoulders. The man she was speaking to was sitting in a wheel chair, holding a shield and sword, and wearing a helmet. The shield, sword, and helmet were made of paper and glue. They had begun to droop a little. Billy supposed this was why he looked like an elephant. Billy was starting to laugh when he saw the woman in pink looking at him. \"Well, don\u0027tjust sit there spying. Come on in,\" said another man. This man was speaking to Billy. He walked in. \"Who are you?\" they asked. Billy explained that he was waiting for his mother, the nurse. The seniors introduced themselves. The woman in pink was named Mildred. The man with the shield was Harold. \"Pleased to meet you,\" said Billy. He asked them what they were doing. \"We\u0027re rehearsing for the talent show,\" said Mildred. \"You have a talent show here?\" asked Billy. \"Of course,\" said Mildred. \"We\u0027re the Senior Center Dramatic Society. We always perform in the talent show, and we rehearse even when there isn\u0027t a show coming up. Sometimes we make up our own plays.\" \"It\u0027s important to be creative,\" said Harold. \"It keeps you young.\" \"Would you like to help us?\" asked Mildred. \"We need an impartial critic.\" \"My mother told me I\u0027m dramatic,\" said Billy. \"Great,\" said Mildred. \"You\u0027ll fit right in.\" Billy agreed to help. He helped them read their lines and fix their costumes. Afterwards, they took Billy back to the nurse\u0027s station where his mother was waiting. \"Did you have fun?\" his mother asked Billy. \"Yes, I did,\" Billy answered. From that day on Billy spent his afternoons at the center with the Dramatic Society. The seniors weren\u0027t boring at all. "

In the book, a boy named Timmy spends the day with his grandfather, Grandpa Joe. The story takes place in the present and the past. Timmy and his grandfather visit an old farm where Grandpa Joe grew up. Timmy sees the old farmhouse, barn, and tractor. For Grandpa Joe, seeing the tractor brings back special memories. He tells Timmy all about his life on the farm. After I read Grandpa\u0027s Tractor yesterday, I wondered about my grandpa Cesar\u0027s memories. I called him on the phone. \"What were things like for you growing up, Grandpa?\" | asked. \"Did you live on a farm?\" \"No,\" he said. \"I grew up in a small village in Mexico.\" Mexico is a country south of the United States. \"My parents worked on a farm where they picked vegetables,\" Grandpa told me. \"But I went to school in the village. When I was seven years old, my family moved to the United States.\" My grandfather\u0027s life as a boy was different from the grandpa\u0027s in the book. It was also very different from my life now.

A native is someone who was born in a place. The family\u0027s first stop was in West Virginia. Every evening, Maya and her family would make a campfire. She loved that! She also enjoyed sleeping in a tent each night. Maya wanted to remember everything that happened on her vacation. Whenever she came across a new animal, such as a beaver or a quail, she would draw a picture of it in herjournal. Maya learned that she had to be quiet if she wanted the animals to stay. She also drew a field of daisies. Maya thought that flowers were easier to draw than animals. They didn\u0027t run away! "

        "text": "Wind Power By Rachelle Kreisman \u0027m\u0027\" A windmill is a machine that runs on the power of the wind. Long ago, farmers used windmills to pump water and make flour. Each windmill had blades at the top of a tower. When the wind blew, its power made the blades spin. The spinning blades turned a pole inside the tower. The pole then ran a water pump or moved a stone that ground, or mashed, grain into little pieces. Today, people have learned how to get much more power from the wind. We have made a lot of progress! Now we have wind turbines. These turbines are modern windmills. Wind turbines have large blades at the top of a high pole. The blades spin quickly when the wind blows. When the blades spin, they power a generator. That is a machine that makes electricity. Electricity brings light and power to homes and businesses. Wind turbines are often built in a group in many rows. That group is called a wind farm. Wind farms produce a large amount of electricity. "

        "text": "People have been eating butter for a long time. H was it made in the past? Do we produce it differently today? Long ago, working women called milkmaids poured cow\u0027s milk into pans. The milkmaids knew that when milk got warm, part of it turned into cream. They waited till cream rose to the top of the milk. Then they removed it and let it get sour. That gave the cream flavor. These workers poured the sour cream into wooden tubs called churns. Churns had big paddles that had to be pushed and pulled. That hard work turned cream into butter! The butter was rinsed with cold water. Finally, salt was added to keep the butter from spoiling. Today, we produce butter a little differently. First, cow\u0027s milk goes into big cans that spin the milk. Cream moves to the top. The cream is heated to kill germs. The cooled cream goes into a metal churn that spins like a clothes dryer. The churn tumbles the cream. Soon, butter forms. Salt is added, and the butter is churned again. That butter is sent to a packager. It is shaped into sticks, wrapped, and sold to grocery stores. Then people buy it and take it home! "

In some cities, laws said that black people could not sit next to white people on buses. Other laws did not allow black people to use the same drinking fountains or restrooms as white people. One day, an African American woman named Rosa Parks got on a bus. After she sat down, the bus became full. The bus driver told Rosa to give up her seat to a white man. Rosa refused. She believed it was not fair that she had to give up her seat. Rosa was arrested after refusing to move. People heard about Rosa\u0027s protest against the law. Some people said there should be fairer laws. Soon, more people began demanding that the law be changed. Slowly, places in the United States began changing their laws. Bus drivers were no longer allowed to make black people give up their seats. New laws said black people must be able to use the same drinking fountains and restrooms as white people. Rosa Parks spoke out for what she believed in. She was a person of strong character. We remember Rosa today as a hero who worked for fairness and equality. "

The insides of the eggs were gooey, like syrup.I used a fork to beat the eggs. They were still gooey, but now they looked creamy, too. My dad poured the wet eggs into the pan. The eggs heated up. I observed the changes as the liquid eggs turned into a solid. Soon, we had scrambled eggs! I toasted two pieces of bread. Then my dad took a stick of butter out of the refrigerator. When my toast was ready, my dad cut off a bit of butter. I put that butter on my toast. I watched as the solid butter turned into a yellow liquid. Breakfast was yummy! When we were done, we cleaned up. The rest of the stick of butter was getting soft. I put it back in the refrigerator. Next time I use the butter, that stick will be solid again. "

        "text": "Have you ever heard of an avalanche? Avalanches are sudden natural events where large amounts of snow and ice slide down a mountain. As they slide, the snow and ice get faster. In fact, snow from an avalanche can move as fast as two hundred miles per hour. That is three times faster than a car on a highway! Most avalanches happen after big storms. New snow puts added pressure on snow already on the mountain. That added pressure can make the old snow break loose and start sliding. Avalanches are dangerous. Heavy snow moving down a mountain may pull other things along, such as trees and rocks. A powerful avalanche can damage everything in its path. Many people like to ski and snowboard. They want to have fun on mountains. They also want to stay safe. Experts can usually tell when an avalanche might happen. The experts can warn people of the risk. The risk may below or high. People have to pay attention to warnings to be safe. "

        "author": "W.M. Akers",
        "metadata": "Grade: 2 Lexile: 560L",
        "text": "Making Piano Fun W.M. Akers \"Come on, Angie. It\u0027s time to go.\" \"I\u0027m not going,\" said Angela. \"Please,\" said her father. \"We\u0027re going to be late.\" \"Good. I hope we are late. I hope we\u0027re a million years late, and by the time we get to the music school, piano doesn\u0027t even exist anymore. The people of the future will be smart. They\u0027ll understand that mankind is better off without the piano. They\u0027ll understand me.\" \"Okay, sweetheart. That\u0027s great. Please get in the car.\" \"No. On no account. This is America, Dad. Didn\u0027t you hear? Nobody can make anybody play piano against her will. It\u0027s called democracy.\" \"Angela? If you don\u0027t get in that car right now, your mother is going to be very angry at me. And if she\u0027s angry at me, I\u0027m going to forbid you from using the computer.\" \"For how long?\" \"Until Christmas.\" Dad wasn\u0027t joking. Angela got in the car. As they drove, beads of sweat formed on the back of her neck, and her stomach started to feel like she had just swallowed a hockey puck. Practicing piano scared her to death. Her teacher, Mr. Poliakoff, was a hairy old man who talked with a lisp that made him nearly impossible to understand. She could never tell if he was saying, \"I see,\" or calling for a \"high C.\" Uncertainty made Angela nervous, and nerves made it impossible for her to play. Not that Angela wanted to play anyway. She thought that there was no music on Earth more boring than Mr. Poliakoff\u0027s sheet music. For three months, she had gone once a week to learn famous compositions like \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,\" \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat,\" and \"Three Blind Mice.\" As boring as those songs were, they were apparently impossible to play. Each time Angela picked up her fingers she was seized by fear. What if she played the wrong note? Would Mr. Poliakoff shout at her? Or, worse, would he simply shake his head in disappointment? \"Fear is the enemy of success,\" he would tell her, except that when he said it, it sounded more like \"sushshesh.\" But when it came to the piano, fear was all Angela had. \"Timbuktu,\" she said. Her dad looked away from the road to give her a funny look. She went on. \"Antarctica. The Yukon. Kazakhstan. Borneo. Tasmania.\" \"Yes?\" asked her father, finally. \"I\u0027m trying to think of places I\u0027d like less than piano class.\" \"Did you come up with anything?\" \"Nope. Even the middle of the Amazon rainforest would be more fun.\" \"Well, I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve been studying your geography, at least.\" When her father looked away, Angela stuck out her tongue. That would show him. As usual, Mr. Poliakoff\u0027s music school smelled like cabbage. Angela did not know where he might be cooking the foul vegetable, but she was certain she didn\u0027t want to find out. She trudged down the darkened hallway like her feet were made of rocks, glad her father wasn\u0027t there to tell her she was going to be late. \"Not that he cares anyway,\" she thought. \"He\u0027s done his job, dropping me off at the building. He doesn\u0027t even care if I actually make it to class.\" Angela\u0027s eyes went wide. She had an idea. She pressed her back against the wall and slinked away from Mr. Poliakoff\u0027s classroom. She would have to spend an hour in the music school, but that didn\u0027t mean she had to learn any music. She tip-toed down the dark corridor, fearful that her piano teacher might burst out at any moment and bellow, \"You! Come here and practice \u0027Ring Around the Rosie!\u0027\" But the door did not open. Mr. Poliakoff did not catch her. Angela was free. She was sneaking her way to the front door of the music school, planning on passing the hour in the sun, beneath a tree or on a bench, when she heard a funny sound. It sounded like someone playing the piano, scales, but it sounded different than what she was used to. It sounded like the person playing was having fun. She followed the sound. It was coming from one of the classrooms. She peered through the glass window and saw that the piano bench was empty. Feeling sneaky, she turned the handle and padded into the empty classroom. The music was coming from a computer in the corner. She walked towards it, dying to find out what it was, when she learned the room wasn\u0027t as empty as she had thought. \"Hello?\" said a voice that stopped Angela\u0027s heart. It came from a woman with long, gray hair and a mouth that twisted up a little bit at the sides. \"Can I help you?\" \"No,\" stammered Angela. \"I, uh, Ijust heard the music, and, \" \"Do you like the piano?\" \"I hate the piano,\" said Angela. The woman started to laugh. \"Well!\" she said. \"That\u0027s too bad for you, since you\u0027re in a music school.\" \"No kidding.\" \"I\u0027m Mrs. O\u0027Hara.\" \"That\u0027s nice. I should be going.\" \"Hold on, hold on. You wanted to know about this music?\" Angela was silent. \"Come on. It\u0027s okay to be curious. Do you know anything about jazz?\" \"No.\" \"Well, here it is.\" She turned up the volume. The man playing piano tapped at the keys like a baby hitting something with a hammer. He sang like a clown, making strange noises and putting on all sorts of funny voices. The words he sang were even stranger: All that meat and no potatoes All that food to the alligators, yes. Hold me steady. I am ready For all that meat and no potatoes. \"It sounds so silly!\" \"Well, that\u0027s Fats,\" said Mrs. O\u0027Hara. \"Who\u0027s Fats?\" \"Fats Waller. The piano player. He\u0027s the one who wrote the song.\" \"A grown-up wrote this song?\" \"A very talented grown-up. Don\u0027t think about the silly words. Listen to the piano. What does it sound like?\" \"It sounds crazy.\" \"It\u0027s all over the place, isn\u0027t it?\" Mrs. O\u0027Hara was right. None of his notes were where Angela was taught they were supposed to be. He played fast when he should have played slowly; he played slowly when he should have played fast. In between lines, he would shout nonsense like, \"Oh, stop it, Thomas! You\u0027re tickling early!\" Crazy was the only word for it. \"Who\u0027s Thomas?\" asked Angela. \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Huh. Well, I guess I should get going.\" \"You\u0027re supposed to be in class, aren\u0027t you? With Mr. Poliakoff?\" Angela made a face. \"You\u0027re going to make me go back to class, aren\u0027t you?\" \"I\u0027m going to make you learn a little piano,\" said Mrs. O\u0027Hara. \"Because that\u0027s what your parents paid for.\" \"Can I play a song like this?\" \"Not quite yet. Fats Waller spent a lot of time learning to play normal piano before he could start playing it crazy.\" \"He played \u0027Ring Around the Rosie?\u0027\" \"And \u0027Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,\u0027 and \u0027Three Blind Mice,\u0027 and all of Mr. Poliakoff\u0027s favorites.\" \"But ifI learn to play those...eventually I can play this?\" \"You got it,\" said Mrs. O\u0027Hara, as she sat down beside the bench. Angela put her fingers on the keys and prepared to play. Her fingers weren\u0027t afraid any more. "

        "text": "Sometimes accidents turn into inventions. Post-it Notes are a good example. Post-its are those little sticky papers perfect for marking your place on a book page. Two researchers, Spencer Silver and Arthur Fry, accidentally invented Post-it Notes. At the time, they were working for a company called 3M. Silver and Fry were both trying to develop extra-strong glue. But the glue they produced was weak. It did not seem useful at all. One day, Fry had an idea. He put the glue on a piece of paper and used the paper as a bookmark. Fry saw that this bookmark would stay on a page. He could remove it and stick it onto another page. The paper did not fall off. Researchers worked to improve the glue. They made sure the glue stayed on the piece of paper and not on the page. In 1980, the company named the product Post-it Notes. The product was a great success! Today, Post-it Notes are one of the most popular office products in the world. They come in different sizes and many colors. Have you ever used Post-it Notes? What do you think of this invention? "

They stretch from Canada in the North to the U.S. state of New Mexico in the South. The Rocky Mountains also go through Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, and Colorado. The Rockies are the longest mountain range in North America. They have many high peaks. The highest is Mount Elbert in Colorado. It is nearly three miles high. Mount Elbert\u0027s peak is fourteen thousand feet above sea level. In the summer, the Rockies are warm and dry, though it does rain sometimes. During the winter, the weather is wet and very cold. Heavy winter snow falls in the higher parts of the Rockies. Many people like to visit these mountains. Here they ride bikes, hike on trails, ski, or fish. A special area called Rocky Mountain National Park is in Colorado. The national park is reserved for people to visit but not to live in or build in. Visitors to Rocky Mountain National Park are excited to see the wild animals that live there. Those animals include elk, moose, mountain goats, and mountain sheep. "

A landline telephone is one that needs to be connected by a wire to a network of other telephones. Because of the wires, people could not take those telephones with them when they left their homes or offices. What if you had to make a call while you were away from home? You had to find a pay phone. Pay phones are landlines found in public places. Many pay phones are on the street. You can make a call from inside a glass or metal space called a phone booth. Once you are inside the booth, you put coins into a slot in the phone to make a call. Telephones have seen a lot of progress. Today, many people carry cell phones. Cell phones do not need to be connected with wires. They can be used almost anywhere and can fit in an adult\u0027s hand. Many cell phones sold today are smartphones. A smartphone is a cell phone that has lots of computer-style features. For example, people use smartphones to check e-mail and go on the Internet. And all that can be done using something small enough to carry in a pocket! "

When he was a boy, he lived in an apartment building on the third floor. His dad owned a clothing store. Grandpa walked to and from school alone. After school, his friends often played baseball on the streets nearby. \"We never played with computers,\" he told me, \"because nobody had a computer at home.\" At night, his mom cooked dinner for just the two of them. His dad did not come home till very late.My life is much different from Grandpa\u0027s life as a boy. I live in a house in a small town.  My dad is a teacher, and my mom is a scientist. I take the bus to and from school. Dad is already home when I get there after school. I do homework and sometimes play on our computer. My dad cooks dinner. When mom comes home from work, the three of us eat together. "

        "text": "Think of a pond with water, rocks, and mud. Animals live there. Plants grow all around it. Rain falls into the pond, or the sun shines above it. A pond is an ecosystem. Ecosystems are places where living things, animals and plants, exist with nonliving things, such as water and soil. Everything in an ecosystem affects everything else. Sometimes, outside plants or animals are brought into an ecosystem. These outsiders are called invaders. They can cause real trouble. Here is an example. Nutria (NOO-tree-uh) are small, furry water animals. They look like beavers. Nutria live in South America, but some people brought a group of them to the U.S. These people wanted to use nutria fur to make coats. The nutria were kept on animal farms, but some escaped. They had so many babies that soon there were millions of nutria! In the wetlands of Louisiana and Maryland, these giant groups of nutria gobbled up plants that other animals in the ecosystem had left alone. They chewed up bulrush plants, including the roots. By doing that, nutria ruined the soil, making it very difficult for some new plants to grow. Partly as a result, thousands of acres of marshland in Maryland are now damaged. U.S. wildlife experts have tried to reduce the number of nutria. In some areas, their plans have worked. But in Louisiana, as many as 30 million nutria remain. They continue eating up parts of the wetlands. Scientists are looking for new solutions to this nutria problem."

A budget is a plan for how to spend and save money. Companies and countries have budgets to manage their spending. Putting together a budget can help you, too. Do you get a weekly allowance? That is a regular amount of money you might receive to pay for things such as snacks, games, and toys. What would happen to a boy who got his allowance on Monday and spent it all by Wednesday? He would not have any money to spend for the rest of the week! You can avoid that problem by following a budget. First, figure out how much you have to spend. Include money you earn, gifts you receive, and money you have already saved. Next, write down what you spend money on each week. Maybe you will find you are spending a lot on snacks. Cutting down would help you save some money every week. You could then use your savings for something special. That is the benefit of a budget! "

The Grand Canyon stretches for 277 miles. That is a long distance! If you were in a car traveling at highway speed, it would take you about five hours to go that far. The cliffs of the Grand Canyon are made of brown, red, and yellow rocks and sand. It is one mile from the top of the cliffs to the floor of the canyon. The Colorado River flows along the canyon floor. Nature made the Grand Canyon. For millions of years, scientists say, rain and river water hit the canyon\u0027s rocks and sand. Strong winds blew on the cliffs. Water wore down the rocks. Together, the wind and rushing water created the canyon we see today. Even today, wind and water are changing the canyon by reshaping the rocks and battering the cliffs. The change is very slow, but it never stops. A million years from now, the Grand Canyon will look very different. "

Then they leave for their vacation. Moka comes bouncing down the stairs, wagging her little golden tail and barking with joy. \"Moka!\" I shout. \"Would you like me to scratch behind your ears?\" \"Forevermore!\" she yaps. \"Would you like me to rub your little golden belly?\" \"Forevermore! Forevermore!\" \u0027Forevermore\u0027 is the only word I\u0027ve ever heard Moka say. When I have felt lonely, l have asked her, \"How long do you think you will love me?\" \"Forevermore she yaps. When I have felt tired, I\u0027ve told her, \"It is so difficult being a writer. How much longer do you think I should keep trying?\" \"Forevermore! Forevermore!\" Although Moka only ever says that one word, she always says just what I need to hear. Mr. and Mrs. Quimpy have a very special granddaughter named Samantha. One day, while her grandma and grandpa are getting ready to leave, Samantha asks me, \"Hey, Jesse, did you know that the little golden dog speaks English?\" \"You mean Moka talks to you, too?\" I ask, overjoyed to finally find someone else who knows. \"But she only ever says one word,\" says Samantha. \"She says, \u0027Nevermore.\u0027\" \"Nevermore?\" I ask. \"Yes,\" says Samantha. \"I ask her, \u0027Will I be afraid of the dark tonight?\u0027 And Moka yaps, \u0027Nevermore!\u0027 I ask, \u0027Do you think I\u0027ll get too nervous to raise my hand and answer the questions in class tomorrow?\u0027 And Moka yaps, \u0027Nevermore! Nevermore!\u0027 It\u0027s so strange, Jesse. But even though Moka only ever says one word, she always says just what I need to hear.\" Just then, Moka comes bouncing down the stairs, wagging her little, golden tail and barking with joy. \"Hey, Moka,\" Samantha and I say at the same time, \"how do you always tell us just what we need to hear?\" Moka looks at Samantha and me for a long time. \"I don\u0027t know,\" she says at last. \"I just tell the truth.\" "

That is a swampy section in the state of Florida. The Everglades is an ecosystem. An ecosystem is a place where animals and plants live together. Any change to an ecosystem may affect all the wildlife that live in it. In 1975, the American crocodile was listed as an endangered animal. Endangered animals are close to disappearing forever. One reason why the American crocodiles were in danger was that people were moving into the reptiles\u0027 ecosystem. People built homes and businesses on Everglades land. That made it harder for the crocodiles to find food and lay eggs. People who were worried about the crocodiles and other wildlife in the Everglades worked to pass laws to protect the ecosystem. Today, there is good news. Scientists say there are more than a thousand American crocodiles living in southern Florida. The laws are helping the crocodiles survive. "

        "text": "Humans have always traveled on land. But long ago, people realized they could travel on water, too. They just had to build something that would float and carry people. People began making boats out of tree trunks. By carving space in the trunks, people could sit down. Wooden paddles were good for moving these boats through the water. Some people wanted a boat that traveled more quickly. They tried adding sails to their boats. The wind blew the sails and helped the boats move faster. Now folks could travel long distances on rivers and lakes. They could trade food and other things with people far away. About five hundred years ago, explorers began to dream of crossing oceans to find other lands. People began building large wooden ships with three or four sails. Many explorers traveled across the ocean. The trips took months. Over time, ocean travel became faster. Steamships, powered by steam engines, traveled across the ocean. Their trips took weeks, not months. Today, huge supertankers carry oil across oceans. Cargo ships carry food, furniture, and machines across oceans for people to buy and use. Water travel is still helping people get food and goods. "

He walked toward the farm. \"No, Jake!\" Jenny said, and pulled back on the rope around Jake\u0027s neck. Jake\u0027s big brown head came up. He stopped and looked at her. He was not happy- Jenny\u0027s dad, Bill, was walking down the path to the farm. He saw Jake stop. \"Aww, poor Jake,\" he said. \"He\u0027s just barn sour!\" \"What does barn sour mean?\" Jenny asked. \"It means he wants to go back to the barn. He is hungry and tired. Jake is a sweet horse, but he\u0027ll be sour now until he gets home.\" Bill smiled. \"So barn sour is bad?\" Jenny said. \"Jake is bad?\" \"No, Jake is not bad.\" Bill said. \"We all get tired and hungry sometimes. Maybe you should take him home now.\" Bill walked to the barn. Jenny frowned. \"But I want to go to the pond,\" she said. She got down from Jake and pulled his rope. Jake\u0027s head came down toward Jenny. But his feet did not move. Jenny pulled again, using both hands. She pulled hard. Her small round face turned red. Her hair flopped up and down on her back. Jake took two steps down the path to the pond. But then he stopped again. Now he looked mad. Jenny was mad now, too. She pulled one more time, even harder. Her boots kicked up a cloud of dust from the path. \"Come on, Jake!\" This time, Jake didn\u0027t go to her. He pulled, too! Jake was a big, strong horse. Jenny was a small girl. Jenny could not stop Jake. And she didn\u0027t just step. She flew! The rope fell. Jenny fell. It hurt. She looked at Jake. Jake looked at Jenny. Then, he put his head down and started eating the grass near the path. Jenny knew she was not going to win. And now, she was tired too. She could hear Bill ringing the dinner bell at her house. Jenny sighed. She got back onto Jake. \"Come on, Jake,\" she said. \"Let\u0027s go home. I\u0027m sorry. I think I am barn sour too.\" Jake seemed to nod. They walked together toward home. "

        "text": "Farmers Grow Corn By Susan LaBella People have grown corn in America for hundreds of years. Native Americans planted and ate corn long ago. When the Pilgrims arrived, some Native Americans taught them how to grow it. Today, the United States produces more corn than any other country. American farmers plant corn seeds in the spring when the weather is warm enough. If a farmer plants when the soil is too cold, the seeds will rot. Corn needs plenty of space to grow. It has to have a lot of sunshine and the right amount of water. If farmers have good weather, they can pick their corn by September. If the weather is too dry or cold or stormy, the corn may not grow very well. When it is ready, many farmers sell their corn. People buy corn to eat, of course. Some companies buy corn to feed to farm animals. Other companies buy it to produce different foods or drinks. There are even companies that buy corn to make fuel for cars! That fuel is called ethanol. When the growing season is over, farmers let their fields rest. In the spring, many farmers will plant corn again. "

People who run for office are called candidates. During the weeks before an election is held, candidates describe what they plan to do if they are elected. The candidates make speeches about their ideas. They have discussions with other candidates. They may promise to work to change laws they do not like or to pass new ones. Voters listen to these promises. Then they decide which candidates they think are the best. On Election Day, voters go to a public building, such as a school or a firehouse. They vote by filling out a paper form or, in some places, by using a computer. Long ago, only a small number of people in the United States could vote. Some men were allowed to vote, but women, black people, poor people, and young people could not. Over the years, laws were changed. Now many more people can vote. All voters must be U.S. citizens and at least eighteen years old. They all must have registered, or signed up, to vote. At the end of every Election Day, votes are counted. The winning candidates are announced. Soon, the winners will get their chance to do the things they promised to do. "

        "text": "Deep in the woods is a secret tree. Only one boy knows about it. It\u0027s a wishing tree. One day, the boy followed his dog into the woods. They stopped at the tree. \"I wish I could climb this tree!\" the boy said. The leaves began to giggle. \"Hello!\" they said. \"Pleased to meet you!\" \"My name is Noah,\" the boy said. \"What\u0027s yours?\" All the leaves started to talk at once. \"We are the Wishing Tree,\" the leaves said. \"We see good children and give them gifts.\" \"I wish I had one million dollars!\" said Noah. But nothing happened. \"I said I wish I had a million dollars!\" Noah said, louder. \"We heard you the ?rst time,\" said the leaves. \"What good are you, anyway?\" \"very good,\" said the leaves. \"This is a very good tree.\" \"Then give me money!\" Noah demanded. \"We can only give you good things. Things that will make you a better person.\" Well, that didn\u0027t sound like much fun. He thought of a new wish. \"I wish I could fight a dragon!\" he said. \"Do you honestly think we would conjure a dragon?\" asked the leaves. \"I guess not,\" said Noah. \"Well, then, I wish I were brave enough to fight a dragon!\" Suddenly, Noah was standing at the bottom of the tree. \"Wish granted!\" said the leaves. \"Arooo!\" said Peanuts the dog. \"Let\u0027s go!\" said Noah. He and Peanuts ran out of the woods. But Noah didn\u0027t feel very brave. \"Some wishing tree that was! No money! No dragons! What a waste!\" Crack! Suddenly, something hit him in the back of his head. \"Hey, No-Brains!\" someone was shouting. \"Oh no!\" Noah said to Peanuts. \"It\u0027s Mitch the bully!\" Mitch was throwing peanuts at Noah. \"Here are some peanuts for your dumb dog!\" Mitch said. That was the last straw! Neah couldn\u0027t take it anymore. \"Go away, bully!\" he yelled. \"You never hurt dogs!\" \"Aroo!\" howled Peanuts the dog. \"Whatever!\" said Mitch. \"You\u0027re not worth my time.\" Mitch left. \"Yay! He left!\" Noah said. \"Thank you, wishing tree!\" Noah had never told Mitch to go away before. But on that day, he was very brave. Being brave was just like fighting a dragon. Being brave was better than having a million dollars. You see, Noah thought his bravery came from the wishing tree. But the truth is, the tree didn\u0027t grant any wishes. Noah did it all himself. Being brave came from inside. If you could make a wish like Noah, what would you wish for?"

        "text": "Danisha stepped into the elevator and pushed the button for the twelfth floor. It was her first visit to her dad\u0027s office. As the elevator went up, Danisha began wondering: What makes elevators move? How could people work or live in tall buildings without elevators? Danisha sat at a desk while her father worked. She decided to use the computer to learn more about elevators. She discovered that elevator cars ride up and down in a space called a shaft. Strong cables lift and lower the elevator. Danisha read about the history of elevators. She found out that even the builders of the ancient pyramids used lifting devices to pick up huge stones. Modern elevators were designed through a process, or a series of steps, Danisha read. Over the years, people worked to make elevators better. One of those people, Elisha Otis, invented the first safety elevator. His elevator would not fall even if the cables broke. Elisha Otis started his own elevator company in the United States. Danisha had learned a lot about elevators. Now she was hungry. Her dad was taking her out for lunch. As Danisha rode down the elevator, she noticed a sign on the elevator wall. It said Otis Elevator Company! "

One of the first bicycles was called the hobby horse. It was made of wood! People rode by pushing their feet along on the ground. Later, a bicycle that had pedals and metal tires was invented. It was not comfortable. It was called the boneshaker. Inventors kept working to make bicycles more comfortable. Next, the high wheeler was developed. It had a very big wheel in the front. This bicycle was not easy to ride, because the rider sat high up on the bike. The rider could be badly hurt in a fall. Then bicycles began to have two wheels that were the same size. Those bikes looked more like bicycles today. More than one hundred years ago, bicycles began to have rubber tires filled with air. That was a solution to the problem of a bumpy ride. The new tires made riding smoother. Today, children\u0027s bicycles and racing bikes are popular. People ride bikes to get exercise. Bicycling is safer, too. Now people wear helmets, and bikes have reflectors on them. "

In the picture, she was on roller skates. I thought the same thing again: She looks a lot like me. I like to roller-skate, too. Then I took another look. The skates my mom was wearing had big pink plastic wheels. My in-line skates have little metal wheels. I think they go a lot faster than my mom\u0027s did.

        "text": "The United States Constitution divides the American government into three branches, or parts. The legislative branch writes the country\u0027s laws. The executive branch, led by the president, carries out the laws. The third branch settles disagreements about laws. That branch is called the judiciary. The judicial branch includes many courts. The U.S. Supreme Court is the most powerful of these courts. (Supreme means \"the top.\") The Supreme Court is made up of nine judges. The chief justice is the head judge. The eight other judges are called associate justices. The Supreme Court meets in Washington, D.C. It can decide if a law Congress passed is allowed by the Constitution. The court also may decide if something the president did is allowed according to the Constitution. Cases come to the Supreme Court only after they have been heard in other U.S. courtrooms. People who disagree with any court decision may ask, or appeal to, a \"higher\" court. A court is considered higher if it can change the decision that another court made. The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land. It is the last place an appeal can be heard. And after the Supreme Court decides a case, all other American courts must follow the rules it sets. In these ways, the Supreme Court really is supreme! "

Plants get water from the soil. They get light from the sun. Many plants have roots, stems, and leaves. Roots keep a plant attached to the soil and help the plant take in water. Water moves up the plant\u0027s stem to the leaves. The stem also supports the plant so it stays up straight. A plant\u0027s leaves do not just take in water, however. Leaves also take in light energy from the sun. The leaves use the energy and water to make glucose. Glucose is a kind of sugar. It is food for the plant. Yes, plants make their own food!

The chickens started squawking. Because of the noise, the man avoided her. The woman was named Harriet Tubman. She was wearing a disguise. In fact, Harriet was an African American woman who was an escaped slave. The man who avoided her was a slaveholder who had once owned her. If he had recognized her, he would have tried to capture her again. Two hundred years ago, many African Americans were held as slaves. Most slaves were in the southern United States. Tubman helped the slaves escape to the North and on to Canada. Many other people also helped. They hid escaping slaves in houses and churches along the way. This system, a group of people who worked to help free slaves , was called the Underground Railroad. Facing danger, Harriet Tubman showed courage every day. Slaveholders knew who she was, and the police wanted to arrest her, but she kept on doing her work. Today, Harriet Tubman is remembered as a brave leader who made the world a better place. "

        "text": "Alison couldn\u0027t believe she forgot her phone at home. Now she was lost. She was supposed to meet Molly at Circle Art Supply at 6 am. Molly was in college, studying to become a painter. Today, she was going to teach Alison how to paint as well. In order to do that, they needed to buy some art supplies. They needed paint, brushes, and a canvas. Alison liked to plan ahead. She wanted to pick an aisle to meet in, but Molly refused. \"Can\u0027t we have an alternate plan?\" Alison begged. \"Just in case?\" \"No way! I have my phone, and you have your phone. Just text me when you get to Circle\u0027s. It will be easier that way.\" Alison had to admit, using the phone to find each other did sound like the easier idea at first. But when Alison reached into her backpack to pull out her phone, there was nothing in the pocket but an old piece of gum. Now she was stuck, and not just to the gum! Alison knew Molly had to be somewhere in the store, but where? She sat down to brainstorm. \"If I were a painter, what would I need? What aisle would I go to?\" she asked herself. \"Well, the first thing I would need, I guess, is paint!\" On the first floor of Circle Art Supply was a directory of what items you could find on each floor. Circle was located in New York City, and it was four stories tall. It was easy for someone to get lost inside of it, with the twists and turns of the hallways and stairwells. Alison carefully studied the directory. From the first floor, she could take the stairs to the second. But she couldn\u0027t get to the third floor from the second. Instead, she\u0027d have to take an elevator to the fourth, and walk back down a flight of stairs. That meant the third floor was only accessible by the fourth floor. Alison\u0027s head started to spin. Paint was on the third floor, but she was on the first. This was going to be confusing! She went upstairs, then back down again. But she got lost! Alison walked down an extra flight of stairs and ended up on the second floor. Then she had to start all over again. When Alison finally got to the third floor, she saw Molly standing in the paint aisle trying to call her. \"Where have you been?\" Molly asked, flustered. \"I have been trying to call your phone for twenty minutes!\" \"Well,\" said Alison, \"I guess you could say I\u0027ve been walking around in circles.\" "

I said okay, if he would build something different from what I was making. So my brother made a doghouse and a supermarket. When we finished our projects, we played with them for a while.

Some of the greatest heroes did not just do remarkable things that made them famous. In their everyday lives, they behaved in ways that made people admire their character. Character is a group of qualities that make up who a person is. Heroes are often people with great character. Many people with great character are honest. Honest people tell the truth, even when it is hard to do. Someone with great character may also be compassionate. A compassionate person cares about others and works to help them. A person with great character may also be responsible. Responsible people do things they promised to do. Other people can depend on them. Heroes can combine great actions with great character.

        "text": "Maps help people understand the world. A world map shows where places are on Earth. That map helps us see how close or far one country is from another. A road map includes streets and highways. It helps travelers figure out how to get where they want to go. Maps use symbols. A dot may stand for a city. A swing may represent a park. Maps include a key, or legend, listing those symbols. The legend tells what each symbol means. Finding places on a map is not always simple. That is why maps use numbers, letters, and lists to make the search easier. Here is an example. Most maps use a grid, which is like a checkerboard. Along one edge of the grid, small letters are spaced evenly. On another side, numbers are printed in the same way. Those maps include a list of places. Next to the name of each place will be a letter and a number, such as \"A7.\" To find that place, you look for \"A\" on the letter side of the map, and \"7\" on the number side. Finally, you locate the area where the letter and the number meet. Nearby, you should find the place you\u0027re looking for! "

Other events occur slowly, such as when rocks are worn down over hundreds of years. Erosion (ih-ROH-jzun) is the name given to that very slow change. Moving water can cause erosion. Have you ever seen waves crash against rocks on the shore? The water can chip off small pieces of rock. As more waves hit the rocks, the pieces become even smaller. Eventually, those pieces may turn into sand. Ice can cause erosion. Some mountains have solid sheets of ice near the top. During warmer weather, a bit of ice melts. Then the sheet of ice may move slowly down the mountain. As the solid ice moves, it scrapes rocks, breaking off pieces. Wind also causes erosion. Wind can blow sand and dirt. It can carry the dirt far away. In some places, strong wind will push sand against rocks. Over a long period of time, the wind wears down those rocks. "

The people who wrote the Constitution did not want one person or group to have too much power. That was why they divided the government into three parts, known as branches. The branches are the legislative, the executive, and thejudicial. Each branch has its own responsibilities. Any branch can change decisions made by the other two branches. The legislative branch is called the United States Congress. It is made up of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Voters in each state elect their U.S. representatives and senators. Those men and women go to Washington, D.C., to pass laws. The executive branch has the power to carry out the laws. It includes the president, the vice president, and their group of advisers called the cabinet. Every four years, Americans vote to elect a president and a vice president. The judicial branch makes sure laws are written and followed correctly. This branch includes the United States Supreme Court. Nine justices serve on the Supreme Court. The president appoints the justices, and the Senate approves them. The justices\u0027 job is to decide important questions about the country\u0027s laws. "

As they got out of the car, Layla saw her friends. \"Let\u0027s go into the water!\" she called. Layla always had fun at the park in the summer. Families had picnics. The kids played and went swimming in the lake. In the spring, Layla\u0027s dad took her fishing at the lake. They went early in the morning. The lake water was still. It was different from the river, which had water that rushed by. One morning in the fall, the lake had fog over it. Layla\u0027s dad told her how fog formed. He said hot summer days had warmed the water. Then cooler fall air moved over the lake\u0027s warm water. The water vapor, or the gas form of water, in the air became cool. That caused condensation. It changed the gas into tiny drops of water. We can see those drops of water hang in the air as fog. Layla loved winter at the park, too. The cold temperatures made the lake freeze. When the ice was thick and safe, people went ice, skating. The lake changed from season to season. But it was always a place to have fun! "

        "text": "We live on a wet planet. In fact, most of the surface of Earth is covered with water. Oceans are the largest bodies of water on Earth. You probably know that ocean water is salty. Do you know why? It is mainly because rain brings salt from the land and into the ocean! Here is how that happens: Rain falls onto rocks. The rainwater breaks down salt and minerals from the rocks. The water mixes with the salt and minerals. Then it flows into the oceans. Scientists have discovered two other sources of salty ocean water. Some salt comes from underwater volcanoes. Other salt spurts from heated vents on the ocean floor. Most ocean salt, however, starts on land. Lakes are large bodies of water. They are surrounded by land. Lakes usually have fresh water, but some lakes have salt water. The Great Salt Lake in Utah is a saltwater lake. Lake water does not move from place to place. Rivers are filled with freshwater that moves from one place to another. The water in rivers comes mostly from rain. Rivers usually flow into oceans. Streams and creeks are also bodies of moving fresh water. They are smaller than rivers. Streams and creeks can come together and form larger streams or rivers. "

One problem is that flying cars need wings. The wings must be designed so they will not stick out into other lanes of the road. Engineers are looking for solutions to that problem. Two kinds of flying cars are being developed that may solve the problem. One type is called the Transition. It has rotating blades that spin and lift the car. Those blades fold flat against the sides when the car is on the ground. Another kind is named the Skycar. It has large propellers. These propeller wings fold up and can be packed in the car\u0027s trunk. Flying cars will not just fly up from the road. They will have to take off from an airport runway. Still, some people are eager to have one of their own. Nobody is sure when flying cars will be available, but one company already has a hundred customers waiting for one. So fasten your seat belts, and get ready for takeoff. Someday, cars may be on the road and in the air! "

        "text": "Drawing a picture can be fun. Drawing can also help people communicate. Putting an idea on paper is sometimes a good way to solve a problem. Here is an example. Martin wanted to build a new birdhouse. The last one he had built fell apart after one windy night. This time, Martin knew he had to make a stronger birdhouse. He just was not sure how to do that. Martin asked his friend Diego for help. Diego was good at building things. Martin explained his idea about the birdhouse, but Diego was confused. So Martin drew a picture to show what he was thinking. Diego looked at the sketch carefully. \"Why does the hole for the bird need to be so big?\" he asked Martin. \"It doesn\u0027t,\" said Martin. \"You\u0027re right.\" Diego also suggested that the birdhouse could be attached to the tree in a much better way. He drew another picture to show Martin how that attachment would work. After talking a while longer, Martin and Diego drew one more sketch. Then they began building the birdhouse together. \"We are a good team,\" Martin told Diego. \"I think your ideas will make my birdhouse stronger!\" "

        "text": "You know it is important to brush your teeth with a toothbrush to keep them healthy. But how did people clean their choppers before toothbrushes were invented? The first tooth cleaners were thin twigs called chew sticks. The sticks were fuzzy at one end. A person rubbed the chew stick against his or her teeth to keep them clean. About two hundred years ago, William Addis invented something closer to today\u0027s toothbrush. He collected thick animal hairs, called bristles. He attached the hairs to a handle made from animal bone. Addis found that lots of customers wanted his invention. People still wanted to improve the tooth cleaner, however. Animal hairs did not feel great against human teeth! Finally, man-made bristles were created. They were made out of nylon. Then plastic was used for handles. Now toothbrushes could be made quickly and cheaply. Millions were sold. About fifty years ago, the electric toothbrush was invented. It does a great job of cleaning teeth. Today, we have toothbrushes with soft or hard bristles. There are special sizes for adults, children, and babies. The toothbrush has come a long way since chew sticks. Who knows what kind of toothbrush will be invented in the future? "

        "text": "Elizabeth Blackwell was the first woman to become a medical doctor in the United States. Elizabeth was born in England more than a hundred years ago. She moved to the U.S. when she was about eleven years old. At first, Elizabeth was a teacher. Later, she knew she wanted to study medicine. Elizabeth applied to many medical schools in the United States, but they would not take her. These schools were only allowing men to study medicine. Finally, Elizabeth found a school that let her in. Some men at the school did not want a woman there, however. At first, they were not kind to her. After two years, Elizabeth graduated at the top of her class at the medical school. She and her sister opened a clinic for women and children in New York City. They gave medical care to the poor. Dr. Blackwell also opened a medical college for women. She trained women to become doctors. She also gave speeches and wrote books Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell had courage and strong character. She worked hard for the things she wanted to do. Her work encouraged other women to become doctors. "

This old man was not a human being, however. He was a rock formation on a mountainside! To many people, five huge granite rocks in the White Mountains looked like the side, or pro?le, of a man\u0027s face. Some people called him Great Stone Face. The Old Man of the Mountain was discovered about two hundred years ago. For a very long time, Great Stone Face was one of the best-known places in New Hampshire. Then, sometime during the night of May 3, 2003, the rocks that made up the old man\u0027s face fell apart. Millions of years of rain, snow, and wind had worn away parts of the rocks. Finally, those rocks collapsed. Now Great Stone Face was damaged. It no longer looked like a man\u0027s profile. Many people were sad that the Old Man of the Mountain would never be the same. But now visitors look north to another rock formation. This time, they see what looks like the barrel of a cannon sticking out from a fortress. "

        "text": "Joanna said, \"Cindy is going to Brazil next Friday.\" Mona and Lydia had come to her house for a play date. Her big sister, Beth, was with them too. Cindy hadn\u0027t come yet. Her mother wanted her to get started on packing. They were going to Salvador on the northeast coast of Brazil. Cindy\u0027s father had been talking about it for six months. But the girls thought it wouldn\u0027t happen. And now she was going. They could not stop her. Cindy was very sad when she came. She said she didn\u0027t want to go. She didn\u0027t even know where Salvador was. But she knew it was very far and she wouldn\u0027t see her friends every day. How would she get there? How would she take all her books and toys, and clothes? And she could not take her house. Or her dog Biscuit. Where would she live? Cindy wanted to hide in Joanna\u0027s house, so her parents couldn\u0027t take her away. But wouldn\u0027t they find her sometime? How would Cindy find out more about what it would be like? \"It\u0027s easy. There are a number of ways to solve problems like this. We can use designs, sketches, or physical models to figure it out,\" said Beth. Joanna took the atlas out. It was a book with many maps. Beth helped them find Salvador: \"See Cindy! Here we are - in North America. And Salvador is in Brazil; in South America.\" \"It\u0027s not so far,\" Cindy said, looking at the map. \"No, it isn\u0027t,\" Mona added. \"And look here, Sao Paulo is in Brazil too! They have a pancake festival there every year in the summer.\" Cindy was excited now. \"I love pancakes!\" Draw a Sketch. Lydia took out a sketch pad and some pencils, and gave them to Cindy. \"Now imagine,\" she said to her. \"You will be living in a new house. Isn\u0027t that wonderful?\" Joanna said, \"Let\u0027s see how we want your new home to be.\" The girls started drawing. \"Well, that\u0027s what people do before they build a new house!\" said Beth. They drew many rooms: for Cindy\u0027s books, her clothes, and her new dog (who would also be called Biscuit). Cindy looked at the drawing. She decided to take it home for her parents. They needn\u0027t worry about the new house now. She had a plan! Design a Model. \"But how will I get there? And will I be able to take all my things?\" The girls knew she would be going in an airplane. But none of them had ever traveled in one. Does a plane have wings? How does it fly? Will it carry all of Cindy\u0027s things too? Now Beth gave them each a colored origami paper. They made their own airplanes! As they were doing that, Beth explained to them how airplanes worked: where the engine was, where the pilot sat, and where Cindy\u0027s books and toys would be kept. They saw the wings - just like a bird\u0027s! They flew them all around the room. Cindy would be flying too! All the way to Salvador. \"Now wouldn\u0027t that be fun?\" Lydia asked. Cindy could imagine Sao Paulo, the pancakes, the plane, and another Biscuit. She was finally excited! Just then, Joanna\u0027s mother walked in with the phone. Cindy\u0027s father wanted to know when he could pick her up. \"Now!\" she said. "

They capture important events, such as birthday parties or weddings, or they show beautiful places. Years later, people may look at these special photos to remember the past. Long ago, however, cameras had not been invented yet. How did people back then record important moments? Some people told stories about old times. Others wrote down what they remembered. Some people made special drawings to help them recall important moments. Among those people were Native Americans of the Lakota tribe. Every year, Lakota leaders decided which event was most important. A Lakota artist was then asked to draw a special picture of that event. Because each year\u0027s picture was decided on during the winter, the drawings became known as winter counts. For a long time, winter counts were drawn on animal skins. Later, the drawings were done on paper. The pictures told the history of the tribe. Each year, the newest winter count was added to the Lakota collection of pictures from earlier times. That helped people keep track of the years. Today, winter counts are important records of the Lakota\u0027s past. "

When the soil felt dry, I added more water. Today, I saw a tiny stem. The plant is growing! Over the next few weeks, more stems and leaves will grow. Then flowers will grow, too.

        "text": "My aunt Carolina is an author who writes children\u0027s books. She works with an illustrator named Joe. Joe draws pictures for the books. Carolina\u0027s books are thirty-two pages long. After she finishes writing a story, my aunt makes a storyboard. A storyboard is like a map to help the people who are putting the book together. My aunt draws her storyboard on one big piece of paper. The paper is covered with little boxes that stand for pages in the book. Under each box is a page number. Inside the boxes are small drawings. Each drawing shows what Carolina wants to see on that page. Aunt Carolina gives her storyboard to Joe. The sketches help communicate her ideas. After Joe looks at the storyboard, he talks to Carolina about the story. If they agree to change something, they can. They add those changes to the storyboard. When the storyboard is done, Carolina and Joe put the book together. Joe draws pictures based on the sketches. He also adds color. Sometimes, Carolina has to add or subtract words on a page. When the book is finished, it is printed. My aunt always gives me a copy. I love her books! "

        "text": "A windmill is a machine that runs on the power of the wind. Long ago, farmers used windmills to pump water and make flour. Each windmill had blades at the top of a tower. When the wind blew, its power made the blades spin. The spinning blades turned a pole inside the tower. The pole then ran a water pump or moved a stone that ground, or mashed, grain into little pieces. Today, people have learned how to get much more power from the wind. We have made a lot of progress! Now we have wind turbines. These turbines are modern windmills. Wind turbines have large blades at the top of a high pole. The blades spin quickly when the wind blows. When the blades spin, they power a generator. That is a machine that makes electricity. Electricity brings light and power to homes and businesses. Wind turbines are often built in a group in many rows. That group is called a wind farm. Wind farms produce a large amount of electricity. "

Cortes Bank is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and about 100 miles from any land. The west coast is home to many large waves. Cortes Bank is the site of some of the largest and fastest waves in the world. The bank is a rugged, rocky, undersea ridge about 100 miles west of San Diego, California. In some places, the ridge is only 3 feet below the ocean\u0027s surface. Strong winds from winter storms sweep across the ocean\u0027s surface. The winds push the water, causing huge waves to form when the water rushes over Cortes Bank. Because there is no land to slow the water after the bank, the waves stay large. According to weather experts, Cortes Bank produces waves that are more than 70 feet high. That\u0027s as tall as a seven, story building! Some waves move at more than 30 miles per hour. Cortes Bank is considered one of the hardest places to surf in the world."
