        "text": "Long ago, Native Americans invented a new way to travel. They called their invention a canoe (kuh-NOO). Canoes are long boats that people sit in and move with paddles. Some Native Americans needed to go across water to hunt and find food. They needed something that could take them where they could fish. The canoe helped them do those things. The Native Americans made canoes by carving out the trunks of trees. They made paddles from long branches. We still use canoes today like the ones Native Americans invented long ago! "

Some people did not answer their phone calls. Ray came up with a way to send messages from computer to computer. Ray sent the first e-mail in 1971. It was most likely \"QWERTYUIOP.\" What does that mean? Nothing! It was just a test message. Now everyone can send and receive e-mails. Thanks, Ray! "

If a tornado is coming, people should go to a basement or another safe place. They should stay there until the storm passes. "

They make their own body heat. Birds lay eggs. The shells are hard. Birds keep the eggs warm. How? They sit on them until the eggs hatch! Then the bird takes care of its chicks. "

        "text": "Meet Some Desert Animals By Susan LaBella Deserts are very dry places. They get almost no rain. Interesting animals live in Earth\u0027s deserts. Here are a few of them. Jackrabbits have long ears. Their ears help them get rid of body heat and stay cool in the desert. Jackrabbits eat twigs and cactus plants. The desert tortoise digs holes, ca||ed burrows, under the ground. Staying in its burrows helps the tortoise keep cool when the desert sun is very hot. Prairie dogs are fast runners. They run quickly from desert enemies such as coyotes and eagles. Prairie dogs call to one another when danger is near. "

        "text": "How Moccasins Were Made By Linda Ruggieri. Long ago, Native Americans wore shoes made of soft leather. These shoes were known as moccasins (MAH-kuh-suhns).  The leather was from the skin of a deer or a moose. Members of the tribe dried the animal skin, turning it into leather. Then the members shaped the leather to cover their feet. Each tribe had its own decorations for moccasins. Some tribes used beads. In other tribes, members painted symbols onto the animal skins. Some moccasins had hard bottoms. They were good for walking on sharp stones or prickly cacti. Moccasins with soft bottoms were best for walking in leaves. "

Grasshoppers use their short front legs to eat and walk. Their large back legs help grasshoppers hop and make sounds. A grasshopper calls to other grasshoppers by rubbing its back legs against its wings. Can grasshoppers really fly? They can! Their back legs boost them up, and their wings help them fly away from danger. "

She does it to protect the eggs. Otherwise, raccoons and other predators may eat the eggs. Afterward, the sea turtle mother returns to the sea. Two months later, the eggs hatch. Baby turtles dig out of the sand. They cross the beach to the ocean. In the ocean, the little turtles eat and grow. They may live for more than eighty years. Male sea turtles never return to land. Female sea turtles come back only to lay eggs. Then the cycle of life begins again. "

The tiny kangaroo crawls into its mother\u0027s pouch. In the pouch, it grows bigger. It grows fur. It opens its eyes. A baby kangaroo is called a joey. When it is big enough, the joey will leave the pouch. The joey returns to the pouch if it is tired or scared. Very young kangaroos cannot live without their mamas.

Inside your ear is something shaped like a tiny drum. It is called your eardrum. The eardrum helps you to hear. The waves from the guitar make your eardrum vibrate.

Indivisible means cannot be divided. There are 50 states, but they work together. The United States cannot be broken apart. Liberty means freedom. Justice means fairness. The last line means that everyone is free. Everyone can expect to be treated fairly. We say this pledge every morning at school. It reminds us of our promise to our country. "
