        "text": "Look out below! Hot liquid rock is below the ground. Volcanoes are openings in the ground where that liquid can come out. Sometimes, volcanoes erupt. That means they explode. Smoke and hot liquid rock come out of the volcano. The liquid is called lava. Lava can move slowly. It can also move quickly. Lava is dangerous for people, animals, and plants. Some experts study volcanoes. They try to figure out when volcanoes might erupt. Then people can get to a safe place before trouble starts. "
