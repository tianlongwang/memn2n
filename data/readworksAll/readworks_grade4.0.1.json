        "text": "Outside the window, Oscar saw a billboard that said: \"When You Want Ham, Buy Stinson  Ham!\" Soon after, there was another billboard. It said: \"Turn Left for Bronson\u0027s Apple  Orchard.\" After that, there were several billboards about \"Uncle Bucky\u0027s Supreme Fireworks  Shack.\" A few hundred feet past that, he saw another one, advertising a hamburger restaurant  called \"Stuckey\u0027s.\" The hamburger on the sign had turned green. Oscar\u0027s face turned green,  too.   Oscar did not want ham. He didn\u0027t want to go apple picking. And he certainly did not want  a green hamburger. He did want some fireworks, but he doubted his parents would stop for  that. You\u0027re not allowed to have fireworks in the car; not on a road trip, anyway. That is  because fireworks are tons of fun, and road trips are the most boring thing in the world.  There was something Oscar wanted to ask his dad. He wanted to ask it so bad, his stomach  hurt, just like it would have if he had eaten that green hamburger. But he knew that no  matter what, he couldn\u0027t say the words. Oscar did not want to be a brat, and his dad had told  him that this was a question that only brats asked.   The question was, \"Are we there yet?\"   His sister Georgia had asked that a few hundred billboards earlier. It did not go well.  \"Are we there yet?\" she asked.  \"Georgia... \" said their mom.  \"But are we?\" she asked again.  \"If we were there,\" said Dad, \"do you think we\u0027d still be driving?\"  This is what Dad considered a very witty remark. Oscar didn\u0027t think it was funny at all, and  neither did Georgia.  \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said. \"Maybe?\"  That was the end of the conversation.  A few years later, or maybe it was just an hour, Georgia was asleep, and Oscar was  about to explode. At least, that\u0027s how it felt. He wondered if a kid could explode from  boredom. It would certainly liven up the car ride.  He looked at his sister, curled up on the other side of the backseat. He didn\u0027t know how  anyone could sleep that way. Her arms were twisted like a pretzel. Her head was hanging to  the side, and a piece of chewed-up gum dangled out of her mouth. It moved a little, back and  forth, every time she breathed. Oscar thought she looked like a marionette with its strings cut.  Georgia could sleep anywhere. On every road trip, she spent nearly the whole time passed  out. Sometimes, she would stretch all the way across the backseat, and poke her toes into  Oscar\u0027s face. Oscar could never sleep in the car. He was doomed to suffer the whole way  there, just him and a thousand billboards, all with pictures of green hamburgers.  Oscar noticed that his left leg was bouncing up and down. It was bouncing really fast, like a  jackhammer. He did not know when it had started bouncing. He wasn\u0027t sure he could make it  stop.  \"Uh, Dad,\" he said.  \"Not now, Oscar.\"  Oscar was startled when his right hand twitched. It twitched again. It started to bounce a  little bit on its own. Slowly, it rose above his leg. It began to flutter, just as fast as his left leg.  \"Dad, I don\u0027t think I can sit still any more.\"  \"Just a little farther, dear,\" said Oscar\u0027s mom.  Now his right leg was bouncing, even faster than his left. Up and down, up and down.  Oscar was starting to feel like a ball attached to a Ping-Pong paddle. Soon enough, his left  hand started fluttering as well. His head began to shake back and forth. His hair flopped wildly,  like a storm-tossed boat.   \"Dad!\"  \"What, Oscar?\"  Oscar knew he had to stop himself from bouncing before he rattled himself apart. But  there was only one way. It wouldn\u0027t be easy, but he had to do it. He had to ask the question,  no matter what the consequences were.  \"Dad?\" he shouted. \"Are we there yet?!\"  Questions: Can\u0027t Sit Still "

        "text": "Maya tapped her foot as she watched the clock tick away until its hands finally reached  2:45 pm. The school bell rang and all the students in her math class gathered up their books and rushed out the door. Maya followed, slightly slower, watching everyone around her. It was  her last day of high school. Although math wasn\u0027t her favorite subject, she knew she would miss her teacher and the joy that came with solving the hard problems. As she walked down the school hallway, Maya heard her name being called out from behind her. She turned around and saw Se?ora Perez  waving her hand. \"Hola,chica!\"Maya\u0027s Spanish teacher greeted her. \"Hola,Se?ora. ?Como está?\" Maya asked her teacher how she was doing.\"Bien,gracias,\" Se?ora Perez said she was doing well and thanked her for asking. Se?ora Perez welcomed Maya into her classroom.  \"I heard you\u0027re going to Argentina for the summer,\"Se?ora Perez told her student. Maya nodded her head and smiled, excited for her upcoming vacation. She was going to visit her cousins living in the capital of Argentina, Buenos Aires. \"I thought I could offer you some advice!\" the se?ora said. She explained that she lived in Buenos Aires right after she graduated college, starting her career as an English teacher in a high school right in the capital city. \"It\u0027s a beautiful place. I still miss it,\" Se?ora Perez added. \"Of course, I would love some advice!\" Maya exclaimed. Maya had taken Spanish classes all throughout middle school and high school, knowing that she would have the opportunity to visit her extended family once she graduated.\"I\u0027ve never been to South America before, but I\u0027ve heard many good things,\" Maya said. \"What were some of your favorite places?\" she asked her teacher. Se?ora Perez remained silent for a while while she stared out the window. She thought about a few places that she could share with her student. \"There are a few places you must visit,\" she started. \"La Boca is one of the most colorful places in the world,\" she said.Se?ora Perez told Maya about the neighborhood\u0027s vibrant buildings all painted with the brightest blues, oranges, yellows and reds. La Boca is also home to a famous fútbol, or soccer, stadium called La Bombonera. Se?ora Perez said that even though the neighborhood is a huge tourist destination, it is still a working-class neighborhood. \"Make sure you talk to some of the locals,\" Se?ora  Perez told Maya.\"You won\u0027t find the spirit of Buenos Aires in the tourist attractions; you\u0027ll only find it when you talk to the true Argentine people.\" Maya nodded her head, mentally taking notes of all of the Se?ora\u0027s?advice. Se?ora  Perezstarted back up again, this time telling Maya about the Cementerio de la Recoleta. The famous cemetery is covered with beautiful granite, marble and bronze mausoleums. Although many famous people are buried there, including several past Argentine presidents, most visitors come to see just one grave.\"María Eva Duarte de Perón is buried there,\" Se?ora Perez told Maya. \"Have you ever seen?the?Broadway musical, Evita \" she asked the student. Maya shook her head. \"Well, I highly recommend seeing it - it illustrates the life  of Eva Perón,or Evita, who was the second wife of the Argentine president, Juan Perón.\"  Se?ora Perez briefly told Maya about Eva Perón, who played a major role in improving the lives of the poor and fighting for women\u0027s rights while she served as first lady. She passed  away in 1952, but her memory has been preserved in a musical - and later a film - written about her life. \"She truly was an amazing woman,\"Se?ora Perez said.  \"I\u0027ll definitely go!\" Maya said, and added, \"And watch the movie before.\"  Maya thanked her teacher for all the advice and stood up to leave. Se?ora Perez took  Maya\u0027s hands in hers and smiled. \"Be careful, and make sure you take lots of pictures!\" the teacher told her. \"Of course,\" Maya said. \" Adios!\" she called out, throwing her bag over her shoulder. Maya walked out of her high school for the last time as a student, excited for the new  adventure that was waiting for her.Questions: A Trip to Argentina "

        "author": "",
        "metadata": "Grade: 4 Lexile: 1010L",
        "text": "Alex awoke under a pile of his own dirty clothes. As always, the process was slow. According to Alex\u0027s mother, Alex was \"just not a morning person.\" According to his father, it just took him a little while to \"start up his engine,\" like their car did during the wintertime. Alex could smell eggs and cheese being transformed into omelets downstairs. He let the smell carry him out of bed and down to the table, where his father plopped down a huge plate of food, just for him. This new diet, one packed with protein, was supposed to help Alex do better in school. Because for as long as he could remember, Alex had been like the kind of car that ran and ran and never stopped, once it was finally warmed up -- especially after a big bowl of sugary cereal. Which was a problem when it came to school. Alex hated school. He felt imprisoned at a desk for eight hours a day, fighting the unbearable urge to burst into action and buzz around the room. Alex felt much like he did when he was driving with his Uncle Nate. Uncle Nate had a bright-yellow V8 convertible and liked to tear around town in it with his favorite nephew. Whenever they pulled up next to another car at a red light, Uncle Nate would make the engine roar in order to make Alex laugh. \"RRRRrrrrRRRR!\" growled the engine, as if it hated being kept in place when all it wanted to do was just go. \"RRRRrrrrrRRRR!\" Alex would sometimes growl to himself when he felt restless, imagining himself as a little car with a big engine, parked at a stoplight. \"RRRRrrrrRRRR!\" he growled now to himself at the breakfast table, imagining his engine filling up with good fuel and beginning to warm up. Though it startled his parents sometimes, they didn\u0027t mind him sitting there and growling. Because before, he didn\u0027t just stay parked in his seat like he was now. Before he started trying to sit still more often, he would just go, like his uncle\u0027s car did when the light finally turned green. He would race off to school so fast that he\u0027d leave his homework behind, or race home from school so fast that he forgot to take his books. He\u0027d even race around during the middle of school assemblies or tests. And usually, he\u0027d run into someone else along the way. Sometimes, he would knock something over, like a building made of blocks that his classmates had created in the corner. \"Not again, Alex!\" someone would always yell. Lately, Alex had been realizing that that his unstoppable engine was also making life harder for him, not just other people. For example, his teachers had begun to seat him away from other students, in the front of the room, where he couldn\u0027t goof off. Playmates he\u0027d had since preschool had begun to avoid him. His parents understood how hard it was for him to control his engine. Yet they were beginning to worry about what would happen to him later in life. Could he handle high school? Get into college? Have a job one day? Finally, Alex\u0027s teacher, Ms. Jackson, had invited his parents to a \"behavior conference\" where they talked about how hard it was for Alex to stay parked. They all agreed that something needed to change. They needed to think of some ideas to help Alex. First, Alex suggested that maybe they send him to a country with no schools, so he wouldn\u0027t have to sit down so much. His parents smiled, but said that this idea probably would not work. Then, Alex\u0027s parents looked online. They saw articles that said that it might help him to eat less sugar. Sugar made him \"bounce off the walls,\" according to his parents, so they switched his breakfast to eggs. Next, his teacher got him a squishy ball to hold in class. She had seen some other teachers use this with their students. She said that sometimes having something to play with or doodle on could actually help some kids stay focused. After that, they met with the school counselor, whose job it was to think of good ideas to help kids who were having problems in school. The counselor suggested that Alex be given two sets of books, one for home and one for school. If his engine revved up after school and he took off without them, he wouldn\u0027t fail to do his homework. Finally, his parents took Alex to see a doctor. Dr. Kagan said she had met a lot of kids like Alex before. She wasn\u0027t surprised to hear that he was having trouble staying put. It was just the way he was wired, she said. Kids like him were just born with a brain and a body that were all engine and no brakes, and it took time for them to learn to slow down. In fact, said the doctor, some scientists even thought that you could rewire your insides to act differently if you practiced good habits over and over on the outside, like a mechanic working on his own car to make it run better. Dr. Kagan also told him that if he was really having big problems, she could give him some special medicine to help them put on the brakes. Alex had never known this was possible. However, she said, he would have to take a test to be sure that he needed the medicine. And because his parents, his teacher and his counselor were all trying such good ideas with him, they needed to give him time to see if he could make it work. As they left the doctor\u0027s office, Dr. Kagan gave him one last piece of advice. \"Remember, driving isn\u0027t just about getting to where you\u0027re going as fast as you can,\" said the doctor. \"It\u0027s also a good time to notice the scenery, listen to music, and talk to your friends. If you aren\u0027t going slowly enough to do that, you\u0027re going to miss the best things in life.\" Over the next few weeks, Alex practiced slowing himself down. Instead of saying \"RRRrrrrRRRRR!\" all the time, he thought about the sound of brakes, slowing down the speed of a bicycle or a car (\"Skreek!\"). As he continued to put on his imaginary brakes, rather than getting up each period to knock over blocks, he was also noticing that other people\u0027s actions were changing too. Teachers spoke more softly to him, because they could see he was listening. Girls let him stand next to them in line, because they weren\u0027t afraid he\u0027d knock them over like the blocks. His mom didn\u0027t yell at him so much, because he wasn\u0027t losing his homework each day. Maybe there\u0027s still hope for me, Alex thought, shoveling the rest of his fuel--er, eggs-- into his mouth. Maybe school will feel fun for me one day. Alex still had his doubts, but he slipped on his backpack anyway, and headed for the bus, trailing crumpled up homework papers behind him in his wake, and growling \"RRrrrrrRRRRrrrr!\" all the way down the street.

        "title": "The Upside of Dyslexia",
        "author": "ReadWorks",
        "text": "Look at the words in the picture. Which one is the \"correct\" way to spell teapot? If you guessed the word on the top left, you probably do not have dyslexia. Dyslexia is a learning disability that affects the way you see, hear, and express language, and according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, it is the most common learning disability. Someone who has dyslexia, or is dyslexic, might look at the word on the top left and see something that looks more like the word on the top right, or the bottom right, with the letters flipped backward or upside down. Imagine how difficult reading might be if you saw every word in this way! This is what daily life is like for people with dyslexia. We live in a society where reading is very important, not just for school, but for survival. (Think street signs, subway maps, medicine labels, and allergy labels on foods...) So life can be hard for people with dyslexia. However, learning to cope with dyslexia can also equip people with the kinds of survival skills and personality traits that can help them to succeed later in life. Says Emerson Dickman, president of the International Dyslexia Association in Baltimore: \"Individuals who have difficulty reading and writing tend to deploy other strengths. They rely on mentors, and as a result, become very good at reading other people and delegating duties to them. They become adept at using visual strengths to solve problems.\" Take, for example, Richard Branson, the successful founder of Virgin Atlantic Airways, who credits his dyslexia as his \"greatest strength.\" As he explains it, he \"got bored easily\" in school because he couldn\u0027t read well, and teachers thought he was simply \"lazy and not very clever.\" So, he spent most of his time visualizing all the things he would do when he left school. After launching his first business at 16, he went on to start eight different companies and amass billions of dollars. \"On one of my last days at school, the headmaster said I would either end up in prison or become a millionaire,\" Branson recalls. \"That was quite a startling prediction, but in some respects he was right!\" According to Julie Logan, a professor of entrepreneurship at the Cass Business School in that 35 percent of them identified themselves as dyslexic. \"We found that dyslexics who succeed had overcome an awful lot in their lives by developing compensatory skills,\" says Logan. \"If you tell your friends and acquaintances that you plan to start a business, you\u0027ll hear over and over, \u0027It won\u0027t work. It can\u0027t be done.\u0027But dyslexics are extraordinarily creative about maneuvering their way around problems.\" Well-known journalist Anderson Cooper, who frequently visits battle-torn areas and conducts interviews about tough subjects, knows this fact firsthand. Diagnosed as dyslexic as a child, he would \"see some letters backward,\" and relied on the help of a reading instructor to tackle challenging books by authors like Joseph Conrad. \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s an accident that I became a war correspondent,\" Cooper says. \"I\u0027m interested in stories of survival: how some people make it through desperate times and others don\u0027t.\" The television and film world, with its focus on visuals and emotions, boasts a surprising number of other dyslexic superstars. For example, Whoopi Goldberg, an Oscar-winning actress and comedian, was diagnosed with dyslexia after suffering through her school years without being able to understand the books she read. \"You can never change the effect that the words \u0027dumb\u0027 and \u0027stupid\u0027 have on young people,\" says Goldberg. However, she says, \"I knew I wasn\u0027t stupid, and I knew I wasn\u0027t dumb. My mother told me that.\" Now, Goldberg defines herself as a person who believes that \"it is okay to feel differently than the pack.\" When asked about what it takes to be successful, Goldberg says, \"We\u0027re born with success. It is only others who point out our failures, and what they attribute to us as failure.\" Clearly, the experiences dyslexic people can have in facing rejection, overcoming obstacles, and thinking visually and creatively can serve them well throughout life, even if they still struggle to read. And like Branson and Cooper, Goldberg discovered early on that she had these kinds of strengths; she\u0027s been acting in plays since age seven. Her first role? She played a teapot. "

        "author": "Michael Stahl",
        "text": " Dancing Derek loved to dance, but he danced in his own special way. Nobody else in town danced like Dancing Derek. He always did what he called \"The Shake.\" He would hear a tune, smile widely, and shake his left foot. He\u0027d shake his left foot so hard that his whole leg would start to shake. At the right time in the song, Dancing Derek would hop and shake his right foot until his right leg started shaking madly. Then he\u0027d hop again and shake each of his hands and arms. By the end of the song, Dancing Derek had his whole body shaking all over the dance floor, even his head, which would make him a little dizzy sometimes. The most popular type of dance in town was not The Shake, though. It was \"The Shimmy.\" To dance The Shimmy correctly, people had to put their hands straight up in the air. When the song began, they then had to make their whole body wobble. The dancers looked kind of like dolphins swimming underwater, except they were really people who were on land. Everybody liked to dance The Shimmy, except for Dancing Derek. When Dancing Derek would watch dance shows on television, everybody was doing The Shimmy. When he would go to dances either in town or at school, all the others on the dance floor would, of course, dance The Shimmy. Dancing Derek only did The Shake. He did not want to be like everybody else. However, every time Dancing Derek would go to dances, he was always bumping into everyone else on the dance floor, making everyone upset at him. He didn\u0027t want that to be true anymore. One day Dancing Derek decided he would try and learn how to do The Shimmyjust in time for The Big Dance. He asked his friend Sarah to teach him. They put on some fun, upbeat music, and Sarah shimmied and shimmied all over the floor. Derek stood off to the side looking on. Soon it was his turn to try. Sarah put on The Shimmy music. Derek started shaking his body like crazyjust like he always did. Sarah laughed and laughed at Derek. Derek only decided to try harder, asking Sarah to put on more Shimmy music. No matter how hard Dancing Derek tried, though, he couldn\u0027t do The Shimmy like Sarah or anyone else in town. He decided he would continue to only do The Shake at dances and just avoid bumping into other people doing The Shimmy. As for those dance shows that he liked to watch, Dancing Derek figured he would have to settle for only seeing The Shimmy on TV. The Big Dance started, and the whole town was there. As usual, they were doing The Shimmy, and, as usual, Dancing Derek was dancing The Shake. On this night, though, there were two differences: Dancing Derek was not bumping into people or getting them angry, and there was a talent scout from a dancing show on TV in the building watching everyone dance. Sure enough,  he asked Dancing Derek to be on the show because he was the only one who stood out.Before long, everyone in town was doing \"The Shake\" because Dancing Derek did it on TV. That made Dancing Derek happy for a while, until he realized he was just like everyone else. Because he always wanted to be different, Dancing Derek came up with a new dance of his own and called it \"The Shiver.\" "

        "author": "ReadWorks",
        "metadata": "Grade: 4 Lexile: 1070L",
        "text": "A penguin is a type of bird that lives mostly in water. The black and white appearance of penguins is known as countershading, which is a form of camouflage that helps keep them safe in the water. Wild penguins are found only in the Southern Hemisphere. Most live within the polar region in very cold climates around Antarctica; however, some species of penguins live in warmer climates in South Africa, New Zealand, and some countries in South America. While there are over 17 different types of penguins, this passage will focus on only three: the emperor penguin, the king penguin, and the little blue penguin. The biggest of all penguins, the emperor penguin, is almost three and a half feet tall, that is almost as tall as the average first grader! And they can weigh up to 88 pounds. Incredibly, emperor penguins breed on the ice in Antarctica during winter. They face temperatures of -22 degrees Fahrenheit and below. After the female lays an egg, the male keeps the egg warm and protects it for a period of two months, during which time he doesn\u0027t eat at all! The female makes a hunting trip for those two months, sometimes traveling up to 50 miles to reach the ocean. When she returns, she regurgitates food for the chick, and then the male goes and finds food for himself. In the wild, emperor penguins live 15 to 20 years. Also, they have the deepest dive of all birds: up to 1,850 feet! The second-largest penguin is called the king penguin. A king penguin can weigh up to 30 pounds. During breeding, like the emperor penguin, a king penguin keeps its egg warm on its feet under a pouch of loose skin. However, king penguins tend to live in slightly warmer climates than emperor penguins; they choose beaches without snow or ice to lay their eggs. The king penguin has a very distinctive coloring, with orange highlights on its head, beak, neck, and upper breast. A third type of penguin is called the little blue penguin, also known as the fairy penguin. These penguins get their name from both their small size and the color of their feathers, which are a light blue instead of black and white like many other types of penguins. Little blue penguins are the smallest of all penguin types, only growing up to a little over one foot tall. They weigh only two or three pounds! They like to live on sandy or rocky beaches, and they can only be found in Australia and New Zealand. They face threats from natural predators such as seagulls, seals, and sharks, and also from introduced predators such as cats, dogs, and foxes. Unlike emperor penguins and king penguins, little blue penguins build nests for their eggs. And while emperor penguin parents take two-month-long shifts protecting their young, little blue penguins take turns more often, switching every few days. Their eggs hatch after only 36 days, and their average lifespan is 6.5 years. Penguins have evolved so they can spend time both in water and on land, although they are much more graceful in the water than they are on land! (Look at how they waddle awkwardly on land and how they glide smoothly through the water.) While penguins cannot fly, they do have small wings called flippers that help them swim underwater. An interesting fact about penguins is that they can remain underwater for as long as 20 minutes at a time before coming up for air. Since they spend most of their lives in water, this is where they get their food from. Small fish and squid make up the bulk of their average diet. Penguins seem to have mastered the art of hunting, they catch their prey with their beaks and swallow them whole! While penguins spend much of their lives in water, they come to land mainly to mate and rear their chicks. After that, it\u0027s back to the water, where they are more in their element. "

        "author": "W..M.. Akers",
        "metadata": "Grade: 4 Lexile: 850L",
        "text": "I hear sounds coming from up above my head. I try to sleep, but the tighter I close my eyes, the louder the noises seem to get. It sounds like someone dragging a rake across a chalkboard. Or...no, it\u0027s more like a bunch of marbles falling onto a linoleum floor. No, not that either. Tonight the sound could be two dozen maracas, rolling back and forth on a lazily tossing boat. Whatever it is, it\u0027s scaring me to death. My name is Drew, and I sleep in the bedroom just underneath the attic. At least, I\u0027m supposed to sleep there. Ever since the noise started, I can barely catch four winks, much less 40 of them. It\u0027s not the sound that bothers me so much as the pictures it puts in my head. Stuff like a rake on a chalkboard. Who could sleep while that\u0027s running through their brain? Well, as my mother likes to say, I\u0027ve had enough of this nonsense. Tonight I\u0027m getting to the bottom of this. The only problem is, even before the noises started, the attic wasn\u0027t my favorite part of the house. In fact, it was my least favorite place, not just in the house, but in the whole world. A lot of people have spooky attics, but ours is the spookiest. We live in a big old house, my dad says it\u0027s \"rambling\", and the attic is way bigger than it needs to be. The lights don\u0027t work very well, and there are all sorts of shadowy corners behind clothes chests and boxes that have been there since long before we moved in. We really have no idea what is up there, and I can\u0027t imagine anything scarier than that. Except, except...except whatever it is that\u0027s making these noises. Tonight I\u0027m not going to let my imagination run wild. I grip my dad\u0027s most powerful flashlight in the hand and check to make sure the batteries are working. I have spares in my backpack, just in case they run out. I also have a water bottle, a sandwich, some chips, and a few cookies in case I get stranded up there. Most importantly, I have my music player. This is crucial because everyone knows that monsters can\u0027t get at you as long as you\u0027ve got music to keep you safe. I jam the headphones into my ears and turn the music up loud. My parents have been asleep for hours when I open the creaky attic door and climb the steps into the darkness. The flashlight beam sweeps ahead of me, illuminating trunks and piles of junk and who knows what else. I creep across the dusty floor, moving slowly and making sure not a single part of the attic escapes my flashlight\u0027s glare. I ignore my sweaty palms, pounding heart, and the sickening sensation in my stomach that I am making a very bad mistake. This isn\u0027t about facing my fears, I tell myself. It\u0027s about getting some sleep. If I can\u0027t sleep, I can\u0027t study. If I can\u0027t study, I\u0027ll flunk out of school and have to join the circus. And the fact is I don\u0027t like the circus one bit. I\u0027m thinking so hard about how much I don\u0027t want to join the circus that I space out a little and am shocked to find myself all the way at the other end of the attic. I didn\u0027t find anything at all. If there are monsters up here, they must be better at hiding than I am at looking. Only now do I realize how far I am from the stairs. This attic is long, dark and full of secrets. And I have to walk back across. More importantly, I have to find out what\u0027s making the skittering noise, or this whole trip was a waste. I take out my headphones and wait for the monsters to strike. They leave me alone...for now. I hear the noise coming from far away. It\u0027s not just right above my bedroom, but seems to be coming from several different directions at once. My ears are playing tricks on me, I think. This is what happens when you don\u0027t get enough sleep. I walk toward the place where the noise is the loudest, my quivering flashlight held straight out in front of my body. There are three boxes stacked on top of one another with writing too small for me to read. I get closer, and the noise gets louder. A label on the box, written in faded marker, reads \"Toys.\" Of course! It\u0027s a box of old toys, probably from a hundred years ago or more. There are probably some wind-up toys in there, and somehow they\u0027ve gotten wound. Each night they rattle up against each other, and each night they keep me awake. All I have to do is take the toys out of the box, and they\u0027ll quiet down. I stand on my tiptoes, trying to reach the upper box of toys. I\u0027m just getting a grip on it, when it slips out of my sweaty palms. It flips over, dumping its contents all over me. My head takes the blow from a bunch of heavy old toys, and my body is covered in 15 or 20 thousand creepy, crawly, fuzzy spiders. Sometimes, it\u0027s not possible to scream loud enough. I run as fast as I can back to the stairs, knocking spiders off my body with both hands. I must have dropped the flashlight along the way, because it\u0027s dark when I get back downstairs, and I can\u0027t see whether I\u0027ve gotten all the spiders off me until my mom turns on the hallway light. \"Drew she says. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" \"I want to switch bedrooms,\" I tell her. \"And you need to hire an exterminator.\""

He explained to the class that the Meadowlands are precious wetlands, one of the last places near New York City where birds migrating from Florida could stop and rest. \"The Meadowlands once had a lot of garbage dumps, which polluted the water pretty badly,\" Mr. Morrison said. \"But most of the dumps are closed now. And the habitat for wild birds is recovering.\" From her yard in the winter, the Meadowlands was as her dad described: brown, dead- looking weeds with Doritos bags lying at the water\u0027s edge. By springtime, however, the reeds turned green and flowers grew along the shoreline. So which one is it, Sarah wondered. Is the Meadowlands a big, ugly, dangerous swamp? Or is it a beautiful oasis of birds and flowers? Despite her dad\u0027s warnings to stay away, Sarah wanted to see for herself. She went under the porch and dragged out her dad\u0027s old fiberglass canoe. She threw the paddle and an old pink life jacket into the boat and dragged it across the yard, down Schuyler Avenue to the edge of the swamp. Whatever it was, she saw now, the Meadowlands was big. Sarah always thought of it as the swamp at the end of her street. Now she realized that the wetlands actually stretched to the north and south, and she couldn\u0027t see either end. Directly across the water, the skyscrapers of Manhattan seemed to line the opposite shore, even though they were actually twelve miles away. Sarah could feel the fear in her throat. But she didn\u0027t want to drag the canoe back up the hill. She zipped the life vest up to her neck, pushed the boat into the water and jumped in. Past the reeds, she found herself paddling in a shallow pond surrounded by muddy islands. She saw ducks, swallows, yellow flowers, purple flowers, white egrets. A blue heron, disturbed by the splashes of Sarah\u0027s paddle, jumped into the air, uncurled its long wings and flapped away. \"This is all so beautiful!\" Sarah thought. The canoe slowed down, as if caught by invisible hands. Sarah looked down and saw the boat was scraping along the muddy bottom. Clouds of brown mud rose to the surface with every paddle stroke, and inside each cloud little bubbles of gas burst when they hit the surface. It smelled like a combination of old paint and rotting food. Sarah nearly threw up. Soon she was stuck. She tried paddling backward to free the canoe from the mud, but each stroke released an overwhelming gas smell. She started to cry. Just then something heavy and dark crashed through the weeds in front of the canoe. A hand pulled the reeds apart, and out poked the head of Sarah\u0027s dad. \"Sarah! What are you doing out here?\" he called. Sarah tried to explain, but all she could do was cry. \"Well, it\u0027s a good thing you dragged the canoe, you left a trail in the gravel a mile wide,\" her dad said. \"Here, take this rope.\" He threw a yellow plastic rope, and after a few tries, Sarah grabbed it. Her dad pulled, and the boat skidded over the mud to shore. Sarah worried that her father would be furious. But when he offered his hand to help her out of the boat, he laughed. \"I did the same foolish thing when I was your age,\" he said. \"Did I ever show you the otter den?\" Sarah wiped tears from her cheek and shook her head no. \"Well, c\u0027mon. I\u0027ll show you,\" her dad said. \"The swamps can be pretty disgusting, but there\u0027s some beautiful stuff in here. You just have to know where to look.\" "

        "text": "Umesh tapped on the window of a black car stopped at a red light. In his left hand, he held a blue plastic bucket full of soapy water that had gradually grown dirty from washing cars. A dripping, brown rag dangled from his right hand. He set both down and peered into the window, cupping his hands around his eyes to see through his reflection. He saw the passenger, an older man dressed in a suit. He held up his bucket and rag, motioning to the windows. The passenger rolled down the window and handed Umesh some coins that added up to 20 rupees, enough to buy the boy a couple cups of tea. He said thank you, and started to wipe down the windows of the car with his rag. Once he finished, Umesh ran off to the side of the street before the light turned green. He covered his face against the black smoke emitted by the cars and buses. It was just another day of work for Umesh, a 10-year-old homeless boy in New Delhi, the capital of India. Umesh is just one of the estimated 300,000 children who live on the streets of New Delhi. Every day, the boy does odd jobs around the city to make money. He can make up to 200 rupees a day. That\u0027s only just over three U.S. dollars. Even though it\u0027s not a lot, it\u0027s enough for Umesh to survive. When Umesh reached the side of the street, he set down his bucket and rag and wiped his brow. The sun was very strong, and Umesh was very hot. He sat down in the dirt and wondered what he could do next. After taking a short break, he wandered through the local market nearby. Even though it was getting late in the afternoon, the market was bustling. Women walked from stall to stall, picking up fresh vegetables and spices for their families. Men pushed through the crowd carrying heavy loads of produce. Umesh wandered around until he found his friend, Shubham. Shubham was also 10 years old, but he was shorter than Umesh by a couple of inches. He was a mischievous boy and always got himself into trouble. Umesh usually was the one who helped him out. Shubham was busy selling fruit to customers. Umesh asked if he could help. The two spent the rest of the day in the market trying to earn as much money as they could. They passed the time by telling jokes and talking about the new video game they wanted to try at the shop down the street. Once it got dark outside, Umesh and Shubham decided to take their earnings to the local shop to finally play that game. A bunch of boys were already gathered outside, all awaiting their turn to try it out. As they waited, Umesh and Shubham went over to the cooler and pulled out two Thums Up, a popular cola drink in India. They paid the shopkeeper 10 rupees and sipped slowly on the cool soda. The cola was purchased with a good part of their earnings that day, so they savored every drop of the sweet drink. When it was finally their turn, they stepped up to the screen and grabbed the controllers to race cars that zoom around a pixelated racetrack. The two boys played until other children started to line up behind them for a chance to drive. Umesh and Shubham walked down the dark dirt path leading to the New Delhi train station. There was a shelter right next to it that provided the boys with small meals and sometimes beds to sleep in. It all depended on how many children came to the shelter each night. When they strolled into the shelter, a volunteer guided them to two beds that sat next to each other. They were lucky that night, but on some nights they had to sleep on the floor. The man left and returned a couple of minutes later with a plate of samosas, a popular Indian snack often made out of spiced potatoes, onions, lentils, and peas stuffed into a fried dumpling. With full stomachs, they immediately fell asleep. Life as a homeless child in New Delhi was hard: Umesh had to work all day in the hot, Indian sun, and he did not always know when his next meal would be or where he would sleep that night. As he drifted off to sleep, Umesh was just glad he had his friend Shubham with him. "

        "text": "Every rabbit likes to lie about in the sun. And in the village of Rabbit Terrace, there are two best friend rabbits that can\u0027t wait to go sunbathing today. Meghan Rabbit and Amber Rabbit want to go to the beach. \"I want to look nice in my bikini this year!\" says Meghan Rabbit, holding up a bright red bathing suit with white polka dots. \"You won\u0027t look too nice in that color with your very white fur,\" says Amber. \"You\u0027re as pale as a ghost!\" \"You think you\u0027re going to make fun of my fur, little miss thing?\" Meghan responds. \"You look like you fell into a bucket of flour!\" \"Well, we\u0027ll just have to see who gets a better tan first. Let\u0027s go!\" The best place in Rabbit Terrace to sunbathe is Carrot Beach. It gets lots of sun, because the carrots need lots of sun to grow. Rabbits also need lots of carrots to grow. And Amber and Meghan need lots of sun to get their tan on!The rabbits use sunblock with an SPF 30, and rub it all over their fur. Then, they pack an insulated cooler bag with carrot juice and head to Carrot Beach. It\u0027s noon, and the sun is bright and hot in the sky. It beats down on the fluffy white rabbits. They walk for what seems like a very long time. Too long. \"Which way is the beach?\" Meghan asks, a little afraid. \"I thought it was west.\" \"No, no, it\u0027s definitely to the east,\" says Amber. \"I\u0027m so tired!\" The two friends stop in the shade for a minute and wipe their brows. They cover their eyes to shield them from the bright sun. Up ahead, they see the shade of tall reeds. It\u0027s scary and dark, but nice and cool. They head into the reed forest and sit on a small rock. Thankfully, they have carrotjuice to keep them from passing out in the summer heat. Carrot juice is removed from the cooler bag and opened. So refreshing and nutritious! They drink it so fast they almost start choking. Slow down little rabbits! Think! Which way are you going? Suddenly, a strange face pops out from behind the reeds. The two rabbits cry out, startled. \"Who are you?\" They can barely make out the shape of the face. He looks old and haggard, with chipped teeth and tangled fur. He resembles a rabbit, but not one they\u0027ve ever seen. \"I\u0027m a wabbit,\" he says. \"That\u0027s a wandering-rabbit. I\u0027ve been wandering in these reeds for ten years now. I know these reeds in and out. And it seems you\u0027ve gotten yourself lost!\" \"We have. But why do you stay in the reeds? You look tangled. Your fur is matted. You never see sunlight!\" \"Bah!\" says Wabbit. \"I couldn\u0027t care less about sunlight. I like the night!\" \"But you need the sun! It\u0027s healthy!\" \"I\u0027ll take my chances in the reeds!\" \"Well, please have some of our carrot juice. It\u0027s good for you!\" Wabbit takes the juice and drinks it. He perks up a little bit. \"Tastes like sunshine,\" he says. \"I guess I do miss it a little sometimes.\" And then, Wabbit points a paw up and out of the reeds. \"That a way! That\u0027s where you\u0027re no doubt headed.\" Looking into the distance, they see the unmistakable glow of Carrot Beach. They have more energy from the carrot juice now, and they hop wildly toward Carrot Beach. \"Thank you, Wabbit! Goodbye!\" And there it is: rows upon rows of carrots. The same carrots that made the carrot juice that got them there. So tall and delicious, growing in the sun. The two friends spread out their beach towels and re-apply their suntan lotion. They place their towels in the perfect spot. Not too sunny, not too shady. All around them are living things. The farmer waters the carrots every morning, and sometimes extra water gathers in a pool. The rabbits dip their toes in the pool of water to cool off. As summer progresses, the sun and water make carrots grow taller and taller. The taller the carrots grow, the less the sun will be able to peek through their leafy green tops. Suddenly, the carrots begin to rustle. The face of Wabbit pops out! \"Wabbit! You left the reeds!\" \"I sure did,\" Wabbit says. \"Well, I won\u0027t be staying for long, but I guess I did need a little bit of the sunshine. My fur was looking mighty...lumpy.\" Wabbit hops away, and the girls decide to pack up and head home, too. The sun starts to set as they make their way. There\u0027s extra carrot juice to give them energy for the hop back home. "

        "author": "James Folta",
        "metadata": "Grade: 4 Lexile: 930L",
        "text": "Matt Nelsen is a Mechanical Engineer for PG\u0026E, which stands for Pacific Gas \u0026 Electric. PG\u0026E is a company in Northern California that provides electricity and natural gas. Matt, as an engineer, designs the pipes that carry natural gas. Natural gas is found underground, trapped in rocks. It can be captured by drilling and pulling it out of the rocks. Once it is captured, it is refined so that people can use it. This gas can then be burned to do lots of different things. Individual buildings like schools. This gas is used for heating, water heating, and cooking. Also, equipment sanitation, and product development. Everything from making electricity to recycling to making all the things in stores can use natural gas. This gas is moved in pipes. Underground there are a lot of pipes that carry many different things in and out of buildings. There are pipes that carry water into a house and then there are pipes that carry the dirty water out. There are also pipes that move natural gas. Matt designs these pipes for This is called designing \"high-pressure transmission pipeline systems.\" This means that Matt figures out how many gas pipes are needed, how big they need to be, and how much gas needs to go through them. Matt needs to make sure that on any day, everyone who needs gas has it. To figure this out, Matt first figures out when the most gas is being used. For Northern California, this is \"in the winter, as customers use more gas when it\u0027s cold out,\" says Matt. People need lots of gas in the winter to keep their houses warm and have hot water for showers and baths. People also use the most gas in the morning, when they want their homes to be warm when they wake up. Also, at this time of day many people are taking showers and they need hot water. So the morning in the winter is when the most gas is probably being used. Matt knows that this is when the most gas is needed. He designs pipes to be able to provide this amount of gas. Matt likes being an engineer because of the problem solving he gets to do. He likes thinking about \"how to approach complex issues and develop intelligent...solutions.\" Matt has to be able asks to fix it. Matt also likes getting to see the pipe systems that he designs built in the real world. He says it is a little scary because his pipe designs affect \"so many people: construction workers, maintenance crews, customers.\" There are a lot of people depending on Matt getting the pipes right! But Matt says it\u0027s worth it when his pipe systems are built. When Matt\u0027s designs are built and work like he expects them to, he says he feels like he\u0027s \"really adding something to help people. It\u0027s a good feeling.\" Matt says the hardest thing is being worried that his solutions won\u0027t work. It\u0027s hard to know what will actually happen. Will there be enough gas? Will the pipes work correctly? Matt says that he can\u0027t \"have every piece of information [he] need to solve a problem.\" This means that Matt and other engineers have to assume some things. Matt can guess how the pipes will work and how many people will need gas, but he can\u0027t know for sure. Not knowing for sure is the hard part of being an engineer. There is a lot of work that goes into making gas pipes work. Matt works very hard to make sure that they work properly. So next time you wash your hands with warm water or you use a gas stove, think of Matt and all the engineers who made sure your house is getting the gas it needs! "

        "title": "Reaching for the Sky: A History of Great Buildings",
        "author": "",
        "metadata": "Grade: 5 Lexile: 1015L",
        "text": "People have made buildings throughout human history. By studying the architecture of a society, you can better understand that society\u0027s values and beliefs. Every society has developed its own style of architecture. Many societies found ways to construct enormous buildings that were used for religious and social purposes. Some of the most impressive early architects were the ancient Egyptians. They lived thousands of years ago in Egypt, a country in the northern part of Africa. The Egyptian pharaohs constructed huge buildings in the shape of pyramids to house their bodies after they died. Pharaohs ruled Egyptian society. They were like kings, but the Egyptians also believed that pharaohs had powers from the gods. The pharaohs thought that the pyramids would be their home after they died and filled them with furniture, gold jewelry and even pets. Now the ancient Egyptian society has vanished but the pyramids are still found in Egypt. Today, pyramids all over Egypt stand as a reminder of the vanished ancient Egyptian culture. Over 130 pyramids have been discovered in Egypt. Egyptian pyramids have a square base with four triangular sides that rise up to a single point. Some of the pyramids are more than 4,500 years old. For thousands of years, the Egyptian pyramids were the tallest manmade structures in the world. The Great Pyramid of Giza is 480 feet above the ground. That\u0027s as tall as many of the skyscrapers in New York City. Historians believe that it took between 20,000 and 30,000 people to help build the Great Pyramid. The pyramid was built out of giant blocks of limestone, a type of rock found in Egypt. The rocks had to be brought from far away on boats on the Nile River. One thousand years later, on the other side of the globe, the ancient Mayan civilization also decided to build pyramids. The Maya Empire was a vast empire that stretched from the area of what is now known as Mexico to Central America. They understood astronomy and had very complex calendars that they used to mark the date and time. The Mayan pyramids looked different from the pyramids built by the ancient Egyptians. Instead of rising to a point, they had flat tops. Along the sides were tiers of steps. The Maya built two types of pyramids. One type was for their religious ceremonies. Priests would climb to the top of the pyramids to conduct important ceremonies where the entire city could see. The other pyramids the Maya built were sacred structures. These pyramids were built to honor the gods and were not supposed to be used by anyone. Humans weren\u0027t supposed to climb these pyramids, or even touch them. Though there were still steps that went up the sides of these pyramids, they were too steep to climb easily. The Maya also built tunnels and secret doors to trap people who might try to climb the sacred pyramids. In medieval Europe, architects also wanted to build tall buildings for their religious ceremonies. In medieval times, religion was an important part of daily life, and churches were often a central gathering place for the community. Cathedrals were the biggest churches in Europe and often took hundreds of years to build. Most cathedrals were built in the shape of a cross, the symbol of the Christian religion. Their building of churches. Gothic churches had pointed arches and many more windows than older churches. The people of the time thought that light was a symbol of God and wanted buildings that were full of windows and light. Medieval architects had to find a way to build walls that were strong enough to support the heavy stone roof of the cathedrals but still had enough windows for light to enter the church. These architects invented flying buttresses to help the walls carry the heavy roof. Flying buttresses were a type of support beam shaped like a stone arch that started at the top of the walls and reached the ground. Because the buttresses were helping support some of the weight, the walls didn\u0027t have to be able to support as much. Now there could be many windows in the walls and the cathedrals could be filled with light. One example of a Gothic church with flying buttresses is the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. \"Notre-Dame\" means \"our lady\" in French and the cathedral was devoted to Mary, and building in northern Europe where the roof was more than one hundred feet high. Notre- Dame\u0027s windows were made with beautiful stained glass that looked like jewels when the light shone through. It took more than one hundred years to build the entire cathedral. That means the people who began building the cathedral were never able to see the finished building. The cathedral became famous when the novelist Victor Hugo wrote a novel called The Hunchback of Notre-Dame about Quasimodo, a fictional cripple who was a bell-ringer in the cathedral. Years later Walt Disney made a cartoon movie based on the book and the church was brought to life in drawings. "

        "author": "",
        "metadata": "Grade: 4 Lexile: 810L",
        "text": "Jamie stood in a tight circle of his friends a few yards into the thick woods behind his house. If someone were to spy on them, he or she would only see the backs of four boys wearing jeans and sneakers, heads bowed to their chests. Jamie\u0027s mother, who went to church every week, might have thought the boys were praying. Jamie pursed his mouth to one side, and thought it would have been much easier if they had just been praying. A small bird lay on the forest floor, its soft-looking chest rising with heavy, labored breaths. Its right wing was twisted at an odd angle, away from its small round body. Jamie\u0027s best friend Mike had thrown a rock at it, as it tried to take flight only ten minutes earlier. \"Did he kill it?\" asked Henry. \"No, look, it\u0027s breathing,\" said Jeremy, the leader of the group. \"It\u0027s really hurt though,\" Jamie said. Jamie looked at Mike, who was silent. His long hair had fallen into his eyes, but he hadn\u0027t pushed it out of the way as he normally did. Jamie couldn\u0027t tell what he was thinking. \"I think we should take it inside and fix it,\" said Henry. \"You can\u0027t just fix it! It needs a vet or something,\" Jeremy said. Mike grunted. They all looked at him. \"Let\u0027s just kill it,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good idea,\" Jamie said. \"Well it\u0027s already in pain,\" said Mike, crossing his arms defiantly. He walked a few feet away and leaned against a tree. \"It\u0027s the humane thing to do.\" Jamie didn\u0027t understand what was going on. Mike had never exhibited any particularly strong feelings of violence. And then today as they all walked through the woods to the fence deep into the forest that marked the end of Jamie\u0027s family\u0027s property, Mike just picked up a small rock and flung it. None of them knew what had happened until Mike ran over to something lying on the floor and pointed at it. \"We\u0027re just going to leave it, okay?\" Jeremy said. \"Good idea,\" said Henry. They started back on the path they had originally taken through the woods. \"What\u0027s going on?\" Jamie asked Mike. \"Nothing, Jamie.\" Mike followed Jeremy and Henry, and soon Jamie felt alone in the woods. He couldn\u0027t hear his friends\u0027 voices, just the soft sound of the wind rustling through the trees. He looked down at the little bird. Its eyes were bulging out a bit. It looked scared, and Jamie wanted to help it. He was angry with Mike for hurting the little bird. Jamie knew that Mike\u0027s dog had gotten hit recently by a car speeding down their block. Mike had told Jamie all about how his dog\u0027s legs and chest had been crushed. He had seen the whole thing. Jamie bent down close to the bird and stroked the feathers on its back. He crouched on his heels, and watched as it moved slowly up and down with the strength of each breath. Its eyes still bulged out, but now it looked calmer. After a few more minutes, it stopped moving. Jamie picked it up and placed it in a pile of leaves at the base of a tree. He began to dig a hole by the thick roots of the tree, and made it wide and deep enough to hold the dead bird. As he worked, sweat beaded on his forehead. Dirt was caked on his knees by the time he had put the bird in the hole, and filled it back up with leaves and other material from the forest floor. When he was done, he suddenly didn\u0027t feel like following his friends to the fence. Instead he walked back toward the backyard with the grass and old wooden swing set. He sat on one of the swings, and skimmed his toes in the unruly grass. His mother was always asking him to mow the lawn, but he never wanted to. After a while, his friends emerged from the forest\u0027s shade and walked over to him. \"What happened to you?\" Jeremy demanded. Henry and Mike stood a little behind Jeremy, Henry shifting from one foot to the other, and Mike looking away, toward the back of Jamie\u0027s house. \"Nothing. I just didn\u0027t want to go to the fence.\" \"The bird wasn\u0027t where we left it,\" Jeremy said. He sounded angry and annoyed, like he had been planning to do something with it. \"So?\" \"Did you move it?\" Jeremy looked back at Mike, as if he wanted Mike to back him up. \"Yeah,\" Jamie said, a little defiantly. \"You\u0027re a weird dude, Jamie,\" Jeremy said. He shook his head, and gestured for Mike and Henry to follow him around Jamie\u0027s house to the street, so they could walk home. Jamie sat in the backyard for a while and watched the sun set. He wasn\u0027t sure what had happened, but he didn\u0027t regret burying the poor bird. Before he went inside for dinner, he resolved to offer to mow the lawn the next day. "

        "text": " \"Mom\u0027s gonna be home late,\" said Fletcher. \"We have to make dinner.\" Fletcher stood in the doorway of his sister\u0027s room. Clara splayed out on a beanbag chair, reading a magazine with a boy band on the cover. She was 13, and Fletcher thought she was probably too old to still have a beanbag chair in her room. He mentioned this a lot, because at 10 years old, he considered himselfthe perfect age to take the chair. It looked super-comfortable. \"Clara!\" he shouted. His sister took off her headphones, but didn\u0027t say anything. She just looked at him, glassy-eyed, waiting for him to speak. \"We gotta make dinner. Mom\u0027s gonna be home late.\" \"What do you mean, \u0027We\u0027?\" \"I mean you and me.\" \"You don\u0027t know how to make dinner.\" \"I do, too!\" \"Toast doesn\u0027t count.\" \"I can make dinner,\" said Fletcher. \"I can totally make dinner. And Mom called me and said she was gonna be home late. She said, \u0027You and your sister will have to fix something to eat.\u0027 That\u0027s what she said. \u0027You and your sister.\u0027 So I\u0027m helping.\" \"Great,\" said Clara. She heaved herself off the beanbag chair and walked past him toward the kitchen. As he followed, Fletcher felt a pang of fear. He didn\u0027t know how to make dinner at all. \"What do you want to eat?\" asked Clara. Fletcher stood over the kitchen counter, flipping through Mom\u0027s biggest cookbook. \"This,\" he said, and pointed to a recipe. \"Coq au vin,\" said Clara. She pronounced it like \"coke aw van.\" \"Did you even read this recipe? It takes like, three days.\" \"That\u0027s gotta be a misprint.\" \"And besides, it calls for wine. Vin is French for wine. We don\u0027t have any, and we\u0027re not allowed in the wine cabinet, anyway. Try again.\" Fletcher flipped to a random page. \"What about this? It looks easy.\" \"Chocolate cream pie. No. We cannot make chocolate cream pie for dinner.\" \"Then how about...\" He flipped to another page. \"Ooh! These potato chips look awesome!\" \"You really think Mom wanted us to make potato chips for dinner?\" \"Maybe...\" \"You have to fry stuff for this. That\u0027s dangerous. We\u0027re not allowed.\" We\u0027re not allowed was one of Clara\u0027s favorite things to say. Whenever she and Fletcher were alone at night, which was a lot, since Mom started her newjob, Fletcher had great never had anything to say but, \"We\u0027re not allowed.\" \"Here,\" said Clara. \"We have potato chips in the pantry anyway. Eat some.\" \"I don\u0027t want boring old potato chips out of a bag. I want super fun, awesome, homemade, fresh-out-of-the-oil potato chips. With cinnamon on them.\" \"We\u0027re not putting cinnamon on the potato chips! That would be disgusting.\" \"Then we are making chips for dinner?\" \"No!\" Clara composed herself. This was something she had to do a lot when she was talking to her brother. She had been doing it for a long time. She would take a deep breath and count to however old he was. If he was still bothering her this much when he was 60, she thought, she would have to count for a long time. \"How about a grilled cheese?\" \"Grilled cheese is almost as boring as chips.\" \"But it\u0027s something we can make without burning down the house. That\u0027s a plus.\" \"I guess.\" \"And listen, it doesn\u0027t have to be boring! We can put all sorts of fun stuff on it.\" \"Like what?\" \"Uh...like carrots.\" \"Carrots are not fun. Even the least fun person in the whole world wouldn\u0027t think carrots are fun. Even Aunt Becky.\" \"Okay, okay! So carrots are less fun than Aunt Becky. But maybe we could use...\" Clara opened the fridge and scanned the shelves. She saw a block of strange looking cheese, the kind she\u0027d only ever had at restaurants. \"This cheese looks fun!\" \"That cheese looks like something they dug up out of the dirt. No.\" \"Well, what do you want on your grilled cheese?\" \"Cinnamon. And candy corn.\" Clara looked at her brother. He wasn\u0027t smiling. He wasn\u0027t laughing. He wasn\u0027t kidding. And so she uttered what, to little brothers everywhere, is the magic word: \"Fine.\" And so they started to grill. Clara established a two-person assembly line, which made their progress that much faster. Because he wasn\u0027t allowed to touch the stove, Fletcher assembled the sandwiches. He laid out four pieces of bread in two lines. On the right hand pieces, he put Clara\u0027s nasty looking cheese. On the left, plain old American cheese and candy corn and lots of cinnamon. He snuck a few pieces of candy corn while Clara wasn\u0027t looking and smiled. This was going to be amazing. Meanwhile, Clara melted the butter. Once it had finished bubbling, she put the first sandwich,  hers, into the pan. She gave it a few minutes and flipped it. It was a little black on one side, but she figured it would be okay. She took it off quickly. The other side had barely toasted. \"Hmm,\" she said. \"I guess it will even out.\" Next she cooked Fletcher\u0027s sandwich. Some of the candy corn slipped out, melting in the butter and turning as hard as plastic. That\u0027s going to be a pain to clean, she thought. To make sure their sandwiches were the same, she cooked Fletcher\u0027s the same way she\u0027d cooked hers: burning it on one side and leaving it pale brown on the other. \"It\u0027ll even out,\" she told him. She sat on the couch and picked up her sandwich. It had gotten cold while she cooked Fletcher\u0027s, but she figured it would be okay. She lifted it to her mouth, took a bite, chewed a little, and,  \"Oh my goodness,\" she said. \"Oh...oh no!\" Fletcher cackled as his sister ran to the trashcan and spit out the sandwich. \"There is candy corn on my grilled cheese! And cinnamon! This is disgusting.\" \"Sorry!\" said Fletcher, not trying very hard to stop laughing. \"You did it on purpose.\" \"No, no, I swear. It was an accident. They probablyjust snuck on.\" \"Snuck on. Candy corn just snuck on.\" \"I guess so,\" said Fletcher, as he bit into his sandwich. \"Blech!\" Fletcher ran to the trashcan. He spit out his mouthful and looked up at his sister. \"You mixed up the two pieces of bread, didn\u0027t you?\" she asked. \"You got candy corn on my sandwich and my funky cheese on yours.\" \"I guess so,\" he said. They looked at their sandwiches, each with one bite missing. They looked at the two bites spit into the trash. \"I know what to do,\" said Clara. \"Throw those out.\" As Fletcher tossed the sandwiches into the trash, Clara stood on her tiptoes in the pantry. She grabbed something off of the top shelf and slapped it onto the table: a $20 bill. \"Get the phone,\" she said. \"We\u0027re ordering pizza.\" "

        "text": "Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Andreas watched the clock. It seemed to be moving very slowly. This was his last class of the day, biology. Usually, Andreas liked biology. He liked learning about all of the different plants. He liked understanding how animals survived in the wild. Usually, Andreas didn\u0027t want biology class to end. But today was different. Today there were tryouts for the basketball team after school. There was only one thing that Andreas liked more than science: basketball. Andreas had been practicing for months. His parents had put a basketball hoop in the backyard. Every night after dinner, Andreas went outside and practiced his shots. He loved the feeling of the basketball in his hands and the sound the ball made when it sailed through the net. Swish! Andreas thought it was the best sound in the world.\"Psst! Andreas!\" Andreas\u0027s best friend, Tyrell, was trying to get his attention. \"I feel like this class will never end,\" said Tyrell. \"I know,\" said Andreas. \"I\u0027m so nervous.\" \"You shouldn\u0027t be nervous,\" said Tyrel You\u0027re the tallest kid in fourth grade.\" \"Height doesn\u0027t matter,\" said Andreas. \"What matters is if you can play the game. You\u0027re a much better shooter than I am.\" Tyrell and Andreas had been best friends since kindergarten. Tyrell loved basketball, too, but his favorite team was the New York Knicks. Andreas\u0027s favorite team was the Chicago Bulls. The only time Tyrell and Andreas fought was when the Knicks were playing the Bulls. Tyrell was also trying out for the basketball team that afternoon. Andreas was glad he\u0027d have his best friend by his side. Suddenly the bell rang and class was over. Andreas and Tyrell walked down to the gym. When they got there, Andreas\u0027s heart sank. There were at least 60 boys crowded onto the bleachers. \"Oh no,\" said Tyrell. \"I never imagined there would be so many kids trying out for the basketball team.\" Andreas knew the basketball team only had room for 20 people. That meant two-thirds of the kids there wouldn\u0027t make the team. Andreas and Tyrell looked at each other. What if only one of them made the team? That would be worse than not making the team at all. The coach blew a whistle and the tryouts began. Andreas and Tyrell were separated into different groups. First Andreas ran sprints across the gym, over and over until his legs felt weak, and he was out of breath. Then, the coaches divided them into teams to play against one another. As soon as he felt his hands on the basketball, Andreas felt better. This was why he loved the game. All the nights of practicing paid off as he took shots from the 3-point line. Swish! Swish! Not all of the shots went in, but a lot of them did. Tyrell was waiting outside when the tryouts were over.\"How did it go?\" Andreas asked. \"I don\u0027t know...I think it went all right,\" said Tyrel The coach said he\u0027s posting a list of who made the team tomorrow before school. So I guess we\u0027ll find out soon enough.\" Andreas felt his stomach tighten. He knew he had played well, but was it good enough? \"It\u0027s okay,\" said Tyrell. Tyrell had known Andreas for so long that he could see when Andreas was upset. \"I\u0027m sure you made it. I just don\u0027t know if I did.\" \"Playing on the basketball team wouldn\u0027t be any fun without you,\" said Andreas. They walked the rest of the way home in silence. The next morning Andreas couldn\u0027t eat any of his breakfast. \"Can we go to school early today?\"he asked his mother. \"I can\u0027t wait anymore.\" His mother nodded and reached for the car keys. Five minutes later, Andreas was standing in front of the gym. He looked at the list. Tyrell\u0027s name was at the very top, he had made it! Andreas\u0027s eyes moved down the list, slowly, reading every name. His eyes began to sting. He didn\u0027t see his name anywhere. \"Andreas!\" He heard Tyrell\u0027s happy voice. \"We made it!\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Andreas. \"My name\u0027s not on there.\" \"Yes it is! Didn\u0027t you look at the second sheet?\" asked Tyrell. Andreas looked back at the list. Tyrell was right; there was a second sheet of paper underneath. Andreas lifted up the first sheet of paper and saw his name at the very top. He turned and gave Tyrell a high-five. They were going to be on the basketball team together. "

        "title": "Sensing the World Around Us ",
        "author": "",
        "metadata": "Grade: 4 Lexile: 970L",
        "text": "All animals have sense receptors, which are organs that receive information from the outside world. We human beings perceive our environment through our five senses: vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. Our bodies are covered with skin tissue. Our skin receptors deliver messages to our brains when our skin comes into contact with different surfaces. These receptors allow us to feel things like pain, temperature, pressure, and vibrations. If you stick your bare hand into the snow, for instance, your sense receptors will signal the thing you have just touched is cold! Very cold! If you take a walk across the beach on a particularly sunny day without sandals on, your sense receptors may tell you that it is hot! Very hot! Once your brain has processed this information, it can store the information and use it later on. The next time you go to the beach, you\u0027ll likely remember how much the sand can heat up and bring your flip-flops along with you. Pain is pretty unpleasant when it happens, but think about it this way: pain protects us. When we sense pain, we know that we should stop whatever it is we\u0027re doing because it hurts. If you rest your hand on the stove while it\u0027s turned on, the pain will alert you to move away. Our sense receptors allow us to detect pain and tell our brains about injuries to our bodies. Memories of painful experiences help us avoid these experiences in the future. In other words, the information collected by our receptors can guide our future actions. Beware of the stove, or get burned again! What kinds of receptors allow us to see the world? The sense receptors involved in vision are called \"photoreceptors.\" Other animals have different types of photoreceptors, but humans have only two kinds: rods and cones. Our rods and cones are located in the retina, the back part of the eye. Our rods are sensitive to changes in light, shape, and movement. They help our eyes adjust to the dark. When you stumble to the bathroom in the middle of the night and, after a few moments, are able to see the door well enough not to bump right into it, those are your rods at work. Our cones allow us to perceive color. They operate best in bright light, which is why it\u0027s hard for us to make out colors when the lights are out. Some people are \"color blind,\" which means that they have difficulty distinguishing certain colors from others, like red from green. This is because they\u0027re missing a type of cone in the retina, or because a particular cone is weak. Olfactory receptors are the ones that receive smells, whether the scent of freshly baked cookies or day-old garbage. All that we smell is the result of receptors in our noses, about seven centimeters up our noses, actually!, detecting chemicals in the air and informing our brains. When you have a cold, the chemical molecules have a hard time reaching the receptors in your stuffed-up nose, which is why you have trouble smelling. Human beings have about forty million olfactory receptors, which are covered with small hairs called \"cilia.\" A dog like the German shepherd has about two billion olfactory receptors. That\u0027s why police officers often use dogs to sniff out whatever it is they\u0027re looking for; their sense of smell is much better developed than ours! Did you know that, of all our senses, smell is the one most closely related to memories and emotions? When you smell an object that you\u0027ve smelled before, it will often bring to mind memories associated with that object. Also, a lot of times we think we are tasting food when really we are mainly smelling it. Our olfactory receptors send signals to the brain while we\u0027re eating, and the brain registers this information as a part of \"taste.\" Receptors in the ear, called \"auditory receptors\" or \"hair cells,\" are responsible for our hearing. Sound waves enter through our outer ear and cause the eardrum to vibrate. The three bones in our middle ear pass these vibrations on to the cochlea. The cochlea is a snail- shaped structure in the inner ear that is filled with a special fluid. When the vibrations move the hair cells (our receptors) on the cochlea, they send signals to the brain. Another fun fact: the canals in our inner ear are responsible for balance. So the next time you\u0027re hopping up and down on one leg, remember that you have your ears to thank! Humans enjoy five different types of taste: sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami (savory or meatiness). Any other taste you can think of is made up of a combination of these. A human has approximately 10,000 taste buds. Each taste bud has 50 to 150 receptors. These receptor cells, or gustatory cells, only live for about two weeks and are then replaced by new ones. Your taste buds lie on your tongue, the back of the roof of your mouth and the back of your throat. Not all animals have the same receptors as we do. You\u0027ll notice, if you ever try and reward your cat with something sugary, your pet doesn\u0027t have much interest in candy. That\u0027s because cats can\u0027t taste sweets. Certain animals sense their outside environment in incredible ways. Butterflies have taste receptors on their feet. A rabbit\u0027s tongue contains 17,000 taste buds. Crickets hear using a thin membrane on their front legs. The box jellyfish has twenty-four eyes. Elephants can hear (and make) very low-frequency sounds that we humans can\u0027t. Whether you taste with your feet or your tongue, hear with your legs or your ears, all of us animals need sense receptors. Without them, we wouldn\u0027t know as much about the world around us. "

        "author": "ReadWorks ",
        "metadata": "Grade: 4 Lexile: 840L",
        "text": "Ghost Dog is a large Cane Corso Mastiff. This is a breed of dog that is very muscular and often weighs more than 100 pounds. Ghost Dog weighs 109 pounds! In 2012, Ghost Dog didn\u0027t have a home or owners. He didn\u0027t have a leash, a dinner bowl, and he certainly didn\u0027t have a dog bed. Instead, Ghost Dog lived alone in a large park in the middle of Brooklyn. Of course he used to have owners. He has clipped ears and a docked tail, which are telltale signs that at one time he lived with humans. But when he was one or two years old, he began living in the park with no one to take care of him. The weird thing was that people did take care of him. In fact, he was a well-known animal in the park, almost a celebrity. In the mornings, one man regularly fed him breakfast. Then Ghost Dog wandered to the dog beach and begged for scraps from dog owners. He spent the rest of the day relaxing in an open field in the park, or playing with other dogs. Other runners and walkers in the park fed him small treats. Sometimes he found scraps of food in the trashcans of nearby restaurants. He didn\u0027t like to be touched, and he didn\u0027t like when people he didn\u0027t know tried to come near him. After a long day of playing in the park, Ghost Dog went to sleep in the hollowed trunk of a fallen tree. You might be wondering how anyone can know the details of Ghost Dog\u0027s daily routine. And that\u0027s where Sean Casey becomes part of the story. Sean owns an Animal Rescue shelter and has spent much of his life helping animals in need. He first heard about Ghost Dog in 2008. He received complaints that a large, wild dog was roaming the park without a leash. The dog didn\u0027t seem dangerous or mean, but Sean wanted to make sure. He sent one of his workers into the park overnight. The worker followed Ghost Dog for 24 hours and learned what the dog did and how he survived. Sean soon realized that Ghost Dog was very happy in the park, and that Ghost Dog wasn\u0027t mean or aggressive or dangerous. Ghost Dog was just a very big dog leading a very happy life in the middle of a very busy city. But Sean was worried. A dog living alone in the park without a leash might cause problems in the future, especially if he became injured or sick. \"We tried to capture him using ropes, but he was too smart. We could never get close enough,\" Sean says. So instead, Sean decided to monitor the dog\u0027s activities and wait until the right moment presented itself. In May 2012, Sean began receiving reports that Ghost Dog was \"haunting\" the park and acting aggressively toward people. He says these reports were ridiculous. \"He\u0027s a sweetheart,\" Sean said. But he noticed something else too: Ghost Dog was injured. He was limping and he moved slowly around the park. He seemed less scared of being captured. Sean knew Ghost Dog needed help. After four years in the park, maybe Ghost Dog was ready for a different home. And so he unleashed a plan. One morning, Sean, his workers, and the man who regularly fed Ghost Dog captured the wild dog using ropes. They began by feeding him treats and circling him until they could get close enough to loop a rope around his neck. They brought another dog with them. This helped distract Ghost Dog who loved the company of other animals. Ghost Dog tried to fight, but eventually gave up and followed Sean into the Animal Rescue van. Sean took Ghost Dog to a veterinarian. Ghost Dog had Lyme\u0027s Disease and an injured knee that required surgery. Sean kept him at a shelter until he was healed. For a dog that lived on his own for so long, Ghost Dog was surprisingly friendly and affectionate. He nuzzled Sean\u0027s leg and welcomed his touch. Sean has spent a lot of time to rehabilitate Ghost Dog. He hopes that someone will adopt him, even if he is \"a bit of a handful.\" "

        "author": "By W.M.Akers",
        "metadata": "Grade: 4 Lexile: 1030L",
        "text": "To get to Ellis Island, you have to take a boat. From 1892 to 1954, many people came here from across the ocean. Millions of immigrants from Europe and beyond came to America through this tiny little island, where they were processed, checked for disease, and sometimes given a new, more American-sounding name. Stepping onto Ellis Island was the end of a long journey, and the beginning of a new life. But for Emily Dalton, it was just another day on a family vacation. Emily, her parents, and little brother, Max, had been to New York City before, but they had never visited the museum on Ellis Island. They took a boat there, too, coming not from Europe, but in a little ferry from the southern tip of Manhattan. Emily had wanted to see the Statue of Liberty, but the family outvoted her. \"Think of it this way, Em,\" said her father. \"You can look at the Statue of Liberty on the boat ride over!\" Emily stared at the big green statue as their ferry clocked at Ellis Island. More than anything else, she wanted to climb to the top of Lady Liberty and look at New York harbor from high up there. Instead, it was time to visit another museum. \"See you later,\" she said to the statue as they disembarked. \"Maybe next summer.\" Emily and her family had been in New York for four days. In that time, they\u0027d done nothing but walk, walk, walk, and visit more museums than she could count. They saw art museums, science museums and history museums. There was even one boring museum all about pieces of paper. Between all the museums and crushing July heat, Emily was nearly asleep on her feet as they walked onto Ellis Island. The main building on Ellis Island has four big turrets, and looks a little bit like a castle. Inside is a huge main room, the Registry Room, where immigrants once waited in line for permission to enter the country. To the sides are lots of smaller rooms, which hold different exhibits about the island\u0027s history. \"Oh wow,\" Emily said. \"Exhibits.\" \"Emily, if you\u0027re going to grump your whole way through this museum,\" said her mother, before pausing for a few moments. \"Well...just don\u0027t!\" \"Oh my gosh, Dad I\" squealed Max. \"They have an exhibit all about maps!\" Max loved maps. Emily did not. The thought of spending two hours watching Max coo over 100-year-old maps made Emily fear she would actually fall asleep where she stood. \"You guys go on ahead,\" she said. \"I\u0027m going to poke around in the gift shop.\" \"Okay,\" said her dad. \"We\u0027ll meet you back here at four to take the last ferry back.\" \"Sounds great.\" As Emily\u0027s family walked excitedly toward the map room, Emily felt her chest loosen slightly. She loved her parents and brother, but there was such a thing as too much family vacation. Now that she was by herself, Ellis Island did n\u0027t feel so had. She was walking toward the gift shop, thinking about purchasing a new mug, when a machine caught her eye. The sign said \"Family Records,\" and it made something stir inside Emily\u0027s brain. She remembered two Thanksgivings ago, when her grandfather told the story about how he immigrated to the United States as a child. He was only seven years old, but he remembered standing in line in a long room in a building that reminded him of a castle, he said Zamek, back in Poland. \"I wonder if this is the same room!\" said Emily, as she began navigating the computer screen on the records machine. Without her family there, she was allowed to feel excited. She typed in her grandfather\u0027 name, last name first: Dalton, Stanley. \"No records in the archive match your search,\" said the machine. \"Darn!\" said Emily. She was sure her grandfather had described Ellis Island.Wait a minute...\" She remembered what her dad had told her about people\u0027s names being changed when they got to the island. The American government forced people to take new names, as a way of making them fit in better in their new country. Stanley Dalton wasn\u0027t a very Polish-sounding name. That Thanksgiving, her grandfather had told them his given name. Emily bit her knuckle as she tried to remember. \"Stan...Stanislaus...Stanislaus Dombrowski!\" A name like that, Emily thought, you don\u0027t forget. She typed it in, and there he was! A picture of an old piece of paper came up covered in squiggly handwriting from January 12, 1930. On line 12, Emily found her grandfather: Stanislaus Dombrowski, whose name was changed to Stanley Dalton. He was from Warsaw, it said, and had never been to the United States before. He was seven years old, and in good health. There was information about his parents, too, and his younger sister. Emily read everything she could about the Dombrowski family, and then started searching for other people. She searched for her friends\u0027 families, for famous people, and any random name that came into her head. And many of them had come through this hall. She was so engrossed that she forgot the time, and was shocked to hear the announcement: \"It is four o\u0027clock. The last boat leaves in five minutes.\" Emily looked up, and saw that the hall was nearly empty. Her family was nowhere to be seen. She ran down the hall, peering into the exhibit rooms, bathrooms and the coat check. \"Max!\" she shouted. \"Mom? Dad? Dalton family? Dombrowskis?!\" When she realized she was the last person in the hall, she panicked. She ran out of the main entrance and up the ramp to the ferry, getting there just fifteen seconds before it left the island. She found her parents sitting in the front of the boat. \"Hey, Emily,\" said her mom. \"You left me behind!\" \"Oh, baby, I\u0027m so sorry. We thought you were on the upper deck with your brother.\" \"We were supposed to meet in the great hall at four.\" \"I think we said we would meet in the boat, dear.\" Emily knew her mother was wrong, but she was too tired to argue. Her vacation stress had returned. She slumped into her seat, watching the castle of Ellis Island grow smaller behind her. As Stanislaus Dombrowski had learned nearly 100 years earlier, she realized then that as nice as it is to get to Ellis Island, it\u0027s even better to catch the boat to Manhattan. "

        "text": "It\u0027s important to make your big brother angry. As far as Sandy was concerned, that wasn\u0027t just herjob, it was her calling. Greg was 15 years old, a skinny kid who seemed to get an inch taller every month and a little bit more stuck-up every day. Sandy\u0027s mission in life was to keep him from getting too big of a head. She had to make him as angry as possible, as often as possible. What else are little sisters for? She hid his schoolbooks. She flicked rubber bands at him while he was talking on the phone. When his friends came over, she was extremely nice to them, so they always asked her to hang out and play video games. This drove Greg crazier than anything else. \"Don\u0027t you guys get it?!\" he would yell. \"She\u0027s such a little brat!\" \"Nah, Greg, you\u0027re nuts,\" one of his friends would say. \"Sandy\u0027s all right. She\u0027s way better than my little sister. She drives me crazy.\" When none of his friends were looking, Sandy would stick her tongue out at Greg. This would make him even angrier. But now that Greg was almost 16, there was something even more important to him than the approval of his buddies. More than anything else, Greg wanted to learn to drive a car. He wanted to be the best in the city, the best in the state. He wanted his driver\u0027s license so badly, the tips of his fingers sometimes hurt from thinking about holding it. Sandy knew how important it was to him, and she was going to make sure he never got it. He\u0027d just finished Driver\u0027s Ed, but Dad insisted Greg practice driving with him a few times before trying for his test. \"Driving with an instructor is one thing,\" Dad said, \"but until you\u0027re comfortable driving with a few people, I\u0027m never letting you touch my car. We\u0027re going to your aunt\u0027s for dinner. Why don\u0027t you drive the whole family?\" \"Sure thing,\" said Greg, his eyes shimmering with anticipation. This would be Sandy\u0027s big chance. After the family climbed into the car, Greg took a few minutes to get ready. He adjusted his seat, fiddled with his mirrors, and familiarized himself with the air- conditioner and windshield wipers, even though it wasn\u0027t hot outside or raining. For all of his confidence, he was starting to look nervous. He was about to turn on the car when Sandy made her first attack. \"Do you have your learner\u0027s permit?\" she asked from the back seat. \"Of course,\" said Greg. \"Maybe you should check your wallet.\" Greg looked at her for a few seconds longer than he needed to before reaching into his back pocket and hauling out his wallet. \"It\u0027s not here.\" \"Well you can\u0027t drive without it,\" said Dad. \"That\u0027s right,\" said Sandy. \"It\u0027s the law.\" \"It was in there this morning!\" \"Sure it was.\" \"Be quiet, Sandy.\" \"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" said Dad. \"I\u0027ll drive.\" \"No! I\u0027m driving. Just wait here.\" Greg threw open the car door and tore into his bedroom. He upended his sheets and all the papers on his bed. He yanked his bedside table drawer so hard it almost flew onto the floor. He checked the pockets of the pants he wore the day before, and he looked in all his shirts. The permit was nowhere to be found. Outside, Sandy hummed happily to herself. Everything was going as planned. Greg returned flushed, but smiling, the permit displayed proudly in his hand. \"Where did you find it?\" asked Sandy, trying to conceal her nervousness. \"The strangest place. It was in the medicine cabinet...in your bathroom.\" \"How odd,\" said Dad, as Greg pulled out of the driveway. Sandy\u0027s first attempt had failed, but she was not defeated yet. She had been reading about safe driving online and spent the whole ride giving Greg unasked-for pointers about the speed limit, turn signals, and when it was safe to merge lanes. \"Remember to keep your hands at ten and two,\" she said. \"I know where to put my hands \\\"There\u0027s no need to yell.\" \"Just be quiet, please. You don\u0027t even know how to drive.\" \"By the looks of it, neither do you.\" Despite her sabotage, Greg kept his head. They were nearly at their aunt\u0027s house when Sandy was forced to resort to her final trick. She grabbed her stomach and lurched forward in her seat. \"Oh no,\" she said. \"My tummy.\" \"Are you okay, sweetheart?\" asked Dad. \"I don\u0027t feel well. I think Greg\u0027s driving is upsetting my stomach. He\u0027s all over the road!\" \"Pull over, Greg.\" \"But Dad, \" \"Pull over! Your sister is going to be sick. I\u0027ll drive the rest of the way.\" Sandy smiled as the car stopped, and her father stepped out. Greg turned to look at her, his mouth pulled back in a tight little snarl. \"Why did you do it?\" \"Do what?\" \"Why are you trying to mess up my driver\u0027s license? Come on, Sandy! This is really, just...you know how important this is to me.\" Sandy looked at him, more upset than he\u0027d been in years, not angry, even, just sad, and her stomach flooded with that rancid feeling that told her she\u0027d done something awful. \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said. \"I just...when you get your driver\u0027s license, you\u0027re going to be gone all the time. You\u0027ll never want to hang out with me.\" Dad knocked on the car window, waiting for Greg to get out. \"One sec, Dad!\" Greg paused for a moment, intent on his sister. \"When you get your driver\u0027s license, where\u0027s the first place you\u0027ll go?\" \"I don\u0027t know...the ice cream place, the mall, the movies.\" Greg got out of the car and let his father in. When Greg was settled into the passenger seat, he said, \"Dad, when I get my license, the first place I\u0027m going is the ice cream place. Then the mall, then the movies, then the ice cream place again. And I\u0027m taking Sandy with me.\" Huh, thought Sandy. Maybe her brother wasn\u0027t such a bad driver after all. "

        "author": "ReadWorks",
        "metadata": "Grade: 4 Lexile: 650L",
        "text": "The new boy bent his head over his desk, quickly scribbling in the answers to his math homework. The teacher had introduced him this morning as Chan, a student from South Korea, who had recently moved to the United States. Charlie watched him, feeling confused. If Chan was new to her school, and her country, then how did he know just what to do on his math homework? Even she was having trouble understanding their new unit, and she\u0027d been in Mrs. Flanagan\u0027s class all year. When the bell rang after math class and the students lined up for lunch, she made sure to stand next to Chan. \"Hey, new kid!\" she whispered, and tapped on the small blue lunch cooler he held in his hands. He looked up, startled. She smiled to show him she meant no harm. \"I saw you going really fast in math class,\" she whispered as they walked down the hallway. \"Do you study all the time or something? Is your mom a math teacher?\" Chan smiled, a small proud smile, and then shrugged. \"Not really,\" he whispered back, keeping his eyes carefully forward. \"We just already did this math in my school before. Maybe a year ago. Or two.\" Charlie\u0027s eyes widened. \"Really? You were a whole year ahead?\" \"In math, I think yes,\" said Chan. \"And the numbers are all just the same in Korea. So I know how to solve the problems.\" \"Wow. You must be a genius!\" Charlie said. Chan shrugged again, less confidently. \"Not really. I cannot do social studies well here, so I study all the time for that. Nothing is the same.\" They took their seats at the lunch table, Charlie sitting across from Chan. The other kids watched them with curiosity, but kept their distance. \"What do you mean?\" Charlie asked. Chan thought about this as he opened his lunch cooler, removing a series of small, clear plastic boxes and a set of two thin sticks the size of pencils. \"Well, in Korea we learn about Korea\u0027s history. We learn about its kings and queens, its wars with Japan and China, its special foods and songs and stories,\" he said. \"And here in America, you learn America\u0027s history.\" \"And we don\u0027t have kings and queens,\" said Charlie. \"No. Or wars with China.\" \"I\u0027m not sure I even know where China is,\" said Charlie, truthfully. \"And I don\u0027t know any American songs and stories,\" said Chan, sadly. \"Yet.\" \"Or about American foods?\" Charlie asked, holding up the pizza her mom had packed for her with a grin. \"Do you know what this is?\" \"Of course!\" said Chan, laughing. \"Everybody knows pizza.\" \"What do you call it in Korea?\" \"Pizza!\" Charlie realized she had forgotten to ask Chan a very important question. \"Chan, do they speak English in Korea?\" \"Well...yes and no,\" said Chan. \"We speak Korean first. It has its own alphabet and sounds. But then from the third grade, we learn English, too. Many of our teachers come from America, actually.\" \"Really?\" \"Yes. So my English is not perfect, I know. But it\u0027s only a little hard. And we use non- Korean words for some things, like pizza.\" Then Chan looked at her devilishly. \"But do you know what we call...this?\" He popped open the lid of one of the clear cubes. Inside was a pile of fiery red...something. Charlie didn\u0027t know what to call it. It looked a little like the sauerkraut she put on her hot dogs sometimes, but crimson instead of cabbage-grey-green. \"No,\" Charlie admitted. \"I will teach you a Korean word then. It is called kimchi: \"Kimchi?\" Charlie repeated. \"Yes, kimchi. It is probably the Korean people\u0027s most favorite food. It is a pickled vegetable and spicy sauce. This one is made with cabbage. You want to try?\" Now it was Charlie\u0027s turn to shrug. \"Sure. As long as it\u0027s not poisonous, I\u0027ll eat it.\" \"No poison.\" Chan held out the two wooden sticks to her. \"Try it!\" \"What am I supposed to do with these?\" asked Charlie, examining the smooth wooden sticks. They looked like drumsticks. She pretended to drum a little bit on the top of Chan\u0027s lunch cooler. Chan laughed. \"Chopsticks? I show you.\" He put one of the chopsticks between his fingers, just like a pencil. Then he held the other one at an angle, so that the two sticks formed a \"V.\" Then, he pinched a bite of the kimchi between the two points of the V and popped it into his mouth. \"Blahhhh,\" he said, showing it to her on his tongue. \"Eww!\" she cried. Then she grabbed the chopsticks. Her first few attempts to hold them failed: they fell out of her hands, then she held them upside down, then she dropped a piece of kimchi on the floor. Finally, she was able to pinch together the two sticks and pick up a bite. \"Mmm,\" she said, tasting a mouthful of kimchi that was sweet, sour, and salty all at the same Chan laughed. \"You like spicy?\" \"Not always! My mom told me that kids don\u0027t like spicy food, so she never makes it,\" said Charlie. \"Wow, I think your mom is really different from Korean moms,\" said Chan. \"A lot of Korean kids love spicy food, and many Korean moms think it\u0027s healthy. Good for you to sweat, they say. It keeps the sickness out.\" \"Wow,\" Charlie said. \"I think I need to go to social studies class in Korea so I can learn about all the things that are different there!\" Chan laughed, then handed her the chopsticks. \"Yes. And now you can start practicing with these every day!\" "

        "text": "I\u0027m a hard-nosed reporter. I ask all the tough questions. I intimidate crooks. I warm over the coldest sources. I get the impossible interviews. My stories are gripping, and to my editor\u0027s delight, I always file them on time. My name is Oliver Acton, and I\u0027m a fourth-grade journalist with the Mars Hill Elementary school paper. It all started back in the second grade. Mom used to read the newspaper out loud at the breakfast table, all the stories that weren\u0027t too sad or scary, so I could learn something about the world before I went to school to learn other things. Sometimes I got so into listening that I forgot about my cereal. Some of the stories were big, about things happening in places really far away, like Egypt or Ohio. Other times the stories were about my hometown, depending on what section Mom read from. I\u0027d always ask who wrote the story when Mom finished reading one. \"A reporter,\" she\u0027d say, and I\u0027d ask again. \"I know but who was it?\" And she\u0027d squint her eyes and make a joke like she couldn\u0027t read the name, and then she\u0027d tell me it was George Limerick or Sharon Newry or Sidney Alexander or Blaine Whiting. And I wondered who those people were and how they got their jobs. And I decided to write my own stories. At first I didn\u0027t really know what I was doing. I just made up lots of fake news. I wrote in crayon on white paper and drew lines for columns, and when I showed it to my mom, she laughed and said \"how cute.\" When I got mad at her for saying my newspaper was \"cute,\" she explained to me that news was true, and that I needed to write about real things. That was back in the second grade. I\u0027ve practiced a lot since then, and I know how to find stories instead of making them up. I can spell better, too. When I started out, I was just writing little things at home - about the bird that met its demise at the teeth of my cat, Jasper, or the tragedy of the flowers: when every single one of Mom\u0027s paper-white bulbs got washed out in a storm. (Mom stood in the mud when the rain stopped, crying.) When I turned eight, I started writing articles during class, usually about something that happened at recess, like the amazing game-winning home run Karen Madison made during a kickball game, when she was always the last person picked to be on teams because she\u0027s tiny and really quiet. My teacher caught me doing it instead of classwork one afternoon and sent me to the principal\u0027s office, but I didn\u0027t get in trouble there. \"Oliver, you\u0027ve got talent,\" Dr. Reed told me. \"And better yet, you\u0027ve found something you really like to do.\" \"Yes Ma\u0027am, I do really like to tell stories, but I like telling real ones.\" \"And that\u0027s great, Oliver. I want you to do that. You just can\u0027t do it in class when you\u0027re supposed to be paying attention to the lessons at hand.\" She cleared her throat, and reached for a stack of papers on her windowsill. \"But I want you to keep writing. And I think you\u0027d be perfect for this.\" That\u0027s when I found out that my school had a newspaper. \"It\u0027s mostly written for and put together by the fifth graders,\" Dr. Reed said, \"but I think you\u0027d be a welcome new voice.\" And that was that. I left the office without so much as detention! I was eight years old and a brand-new reporter. I started with small stories. A lot of the time, I just wrote what my editor, the fifth-grade English teacher, assigned me. That meant I interviewed a lot of kids about band concerts, soccer games, and art shows. It wasn\u0027t until this year, in the fourth grade, that I got my big breaking story. From the Mars Hill Elementary Gazette, week of October 21-25: The playground is a noisy place. Everyone is doing something, and most of those things make sounds. Balls hit the ground with a hollow thud; kids yell and laugh; the Elementary. A splash and a scream came from the duck pond just outside the baseball diamond. Darren Fitch, a fourth-grader, who was playing kickball, missed his pitch. \"I turned to look and see who screamed.\" His teammates yelled at him for getting a strike, but he knew something was wrong. It was Kami Phillips, a second-grader. She had fallen into the water. There is fencing all around the pond, but a recent thunderstorm knocked a heavy branch into the fence which broke a section. \"I didn\u0027t see her fall in, but I heard her yell, and then I saw her splashing,\" said Darren. And then everyone went running. Soon, the pond was surrounded by students. They were all shouting and trying to figure out how to help Kami. \"She was yelling for help, but I think we all knew better than to jump in, too,\" said fifth-grader, Ann Berkowitz. But Kami couldn\u0027t swim, and she needed someone to get her, and fast. That\u0027s when recess officer, Ms. Belfast, came running. The third-grade teacher has recess duty every Tuesday and Thursday, keeping an eye on all the kids to make sure no one gets hurt. She got to do her job to the extreme on Thursday. \"Ms. Belfast just ran up, dove in, and swam over to Kami,\" said Ann. \"It was awesome!\" In a moment, both Kami and Ms. Belfast were sitting on the side of the pond, and sirens in the distance got louder. An ambulance showed up, and a rescue crew took it from there, wrapping Kami in a blanket. \"I really want to thank Ms. Belfast!\" Kami said, in a thank-you note her mom brought to the school the next day. It seems Mars Hill has a hero. "

        "text": "\"I want it to have six heads,\" said Carlos. \"No,\" said Mariso It has two heads. One breathes fire, and one sprays water. That way, if he starts a fire he shouldn\u0027t, he can put it out, much safer.\" \"What about his arms? I\u0027m thinking his right hand should be a chainsaw, and his left should be a hammer. And maybe there should be a claw sticking out of his chest.\" \"Are you nuts? What\u0027s he going to do with a chainsaw and a hammer?\" \"Saw stuff. Hammer stuff .\" \"I think he\u0027ll be much better with plain old ordinary hands.\" Carlos looked at his sister like she had just grown five extra heads. \"Ordinary hands? We don\u0027t want ordinary anything. We\u0027re going to build the best robot the universe has ever seen.\u0027 They were sitting outside of school, waiting for their mother to pick them up. While kids around them played, ran and screamed, Carlos and Marisol hunched over a notebook. Its page was doodled carefully with rockets, laser guns, cannons and slingshots, like the blueprints for a super weapon. There were plans for robot arms, robot legs, robot bodies and robot heads, with eight pages alone devoted to various designs for robot eyes. Should it have laser eyes or X-ray eyes? Heat-ray eyes or ice-blaster eyes? The children were going to have to decide. These are the sorts of decisions faced by children whose parents buy them a \"Build Your Own Robot Kit.\" Carlos first noticed the ad for the kit in the back of a comic book. He immediately began asking his parents to buy it for him. \"Please, please, please, please, please?\" he asked. \"This can count for my birthday and Christmas and Easter and Halloween and, \" \"No,\" said his father. \"You don\u0027t need to build a robot.\" Carlos begged for weeks, but got nowhere. Then, one day, he had an idea. \"Dad,\" he said. \"I want you to get me that robot kit.\" \"I know,\" said his father. \"But not just for me!\" Oh?\" \"For me and Marisol. We can design it together. As brother and sister.\" Fathers like when their sons and daughters do things together. He agreed to order the kit. And since that day, Carlos and Marisol had done nothing but work on their plans. It was not going well. \"This robot is going to be ugly,\" Marisol would say. \"It has too many rocket launchers.\" \"You can never have enough rocket launchers!\" Carlos would shout. \"What if it gets hot in the sun?\" \"Robots don\u0027t get hot.\" \"But what if it goes to the beach? We should give it an umbrella.\" \"Robots don\u0027t need umbrellas. They need flamethrowers and tank treads and grenade catapults and...\" \"It could get sunburned.\" \"Fine,\" said Carlos. He erased the fifth rocket launcher and replaced it with an umbrella. \"I guess that\u0027s okay. Nobody wants a sunburnt robot.\" For weeks, they had been compromising, until they had a robot that was part warrior, part leisure machine. Next to the machine guns was a window box, where Marisol insisted the robot would want to grow herbs and flowers. In between the laser eyes was a unicorn horn, which she thought looked pretty. And above the flamethrower was something she called a \"rainbow cannon.\" \"What\u0027s a rainbow cannon?\" Carlos asked. \"Duh,\" she said. \"It shoots rainbows.\" The robot kit was arriving that day. All that remained was the hands. Finally they settled on a chainsaw and a flyswatter, because \"nobody likes flies,\" said Marisol. Carlos closed the notebook. \"We\u0027re finished,\" he said, as their mother\u0027s car pulled into the parking lot. \"Can you believe it?\" \"This robot is going to be amazing,\" said Marisol. \"Now we just have to build it.\" \"That\u0027s going to be the hard part. Like, really hard. I\u0027ve never built a robot before.\" \"It\u0027ll be worth it. It\u0027s going to shoot so many rainbows.\" Carlos and Marisol burst through the front door, ready to start building. \"Where is it?!\" Carlos shouted. He searched the living room for a ten-foot tall box of flamethrower parts and unicorn horns, but didn\u0027t see anything. \"Where is it?\" \"Silly goose,\" said Marisol. \"It\u0027s probably outside. Something this big couldn\u0027t fit in the living room.\" But the backyard was empty too. So was the kitchen, the garage, the basement and the living room. There was no ten-foot tall cardboard box anywhere. Had the postman been delayed? \"Mom,\" said Carlos. \"Did the mail come?\" \"Yep,\" said Mom, stirring a pitcher of pink lemonade. \"It\u0027s on the coffee table. I think there\u0027s a package for you.\" She was right. There was a package, a six-inch cardboard box with \"Build Your Own Robot!\" written on it in sad little letters. Carlos opened it slowly, and inside found a few metal rods and wheels, and plans to build something that looked like a cockroach, but uglier. \"This robot is terrible,\" he said. \"Where are the rocket launchers? Where are the chainsaws? Where are the tank treads?\" \"It doesn\u0027t even have a rainbow cannon,\" said Marisol. Carlos was about to throw the kit away when Marisol grabbed his wrist. \"Wait,\" she said. \"It may not be as good as our robot, but it\u0027s still a robot. Let\u0027s build it together.\" "

How did magnificent mountain ranges rise up in one place and beautiful beaches form elsewhere? Why do some places experience earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, while other places don\u0027t? How did our continents end up where they are now? All of these questions can be answered with an understanding of tectonic plates. The outer shell of our planet is the earth\u0027s crust. Below the crust is the mantle. The uppermost mantle is solid and rigid, and the lower mantle is fluid molten rock. Tectonic plates are made up of a section of the Earth\u0027s crust and the solid mantle below it. Some tectonic plates are huge: they are larger than countries and even continents. These tectonic plates rest on a layer of hot magma. Imagine some large tiles, like those on a kitchen floor, but with a layer of thick honey underneath. The thick honey won\u0027t allow the tiles to move too fast, but the tiles will move nonetheless. In a similar way, tectonic plates move slowly but steadily. The location where these tectonic plates meet is called a plate boundary. Wherever you find plate boundaries, events like earthquakes can occur, and features like mountains, volcanoes, and ocean trenches are common. When plates collide, mountain ranges like the Rocky Mountains in North America may be pushed up. If one plate goes underneath the other during collision, deep trenches in the ocean and volcanic islands form. This can be seen in the island chain of Hawaii. Plate boundaries also exist where plates pull away from each other. These are called divergent plate boundaries. At these boundaries, magma from beneath the earth\u0027s crust rises to the surface and pushes apart the tectonic plates. Mountain ranges and volcanoes form along these boundaries. When tectonic plates move, they move very slowly. Some plates move as fast as fingernails grow, while others move as fast as hair grows. This may seem very slow but our planet is over 4 billion years old. Hair or fingernails that have grown for 4 billion years without a cut would get very long and look very different. In the same way, the gradual movement of continents over billions of years has caused large changes in the earth\u0027s geography. One scientific theory states that Earth looked very different just millions of years ago. This theory states that continents used to make up a supercontinent called Pangaea. This supercontinent formed 300 million years ago and was basically one giant piece of land. Then about 200 million years ago, the pieces that formed Pangaea started to break apart. When this happened, the gaps that opened between continents slowly formed the oceans we know today. One of these gaps contains the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The ridge is a volcanic mountain range located on a plate boundary in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Forming the current Atlantic Ocean, the plates on either side of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge have been moving apart slowly. At the same time, magma has been flowing out of the volcanoes to create new seafloor. This means the Atlantic Ocean has been getting larger by 2 to 5 centimeters per year. That\u0027s an average of about 2 inches a year. This adds up to millions of inches over the course of millions of years! While the Atlantic Ocean is getting larger every year, the Pacific Ocean is actually getting smaller. There is a massive plate that makes up most of the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Asia on its eastern side to North America on the western side. Scientists have figured out that this plate grows on its eastern side, but is destroyed when it goes under the other plate on its western side. Calculations show that the plate is destroyed faster than it can grow, thereby reducing the size of the Pacific Ocean. You can think of Pangaea as a big, completed jigsaw puzzle. Now imagine the puzzle breaking apart and spreading out. These puzzle pieces are the tectonic plates and the continents that rest on top of them. As they spread out, these plates carried the continents to the place we find them today. Take a look at South America and Africa. Don\u0027t they look like two puzzle pieces that used to fit Sahara Desert were all once very close to each other and not separated by the Atlantic Ocean. There is interesting evidence to support the theory of Pangaea. Scientists have found identical plants and animals on continents that are now very far apart; for example, fossils of a reptile that looked like a cross between a dog and snake, called Cynognathus, have been found in both South America and Africa. Even stronger evidence is found in the rocks of these two continents. Africa and South America are thousands of miles apart, but share very similar rock layers and patterns. These shared rock layers and patterns may indicate that the two continents (and their rocks) used to make up one larger piece of the big Pangaea puzzle. Whether Pangaea existed or not, one thing is for sure: our planet is changing every day and it\u0027s because of the moving tectonic plates. The Earth may be changing very slowly, but just imagine what it will look like in another 200 million years! "

        "title": "Getting a Car",
        "author": "J. Folta",
        "metadata": "Grade: 4 Lexile: 890L",
        "text": "As the head of a family, I have many decisions to make about how my husband and I spend our money. We need to figure out the way to get the most out of what we make at our jobs. Currently, my family is trying to decide whether or not to get a car. There are many different factors involved in making this decision. My family includes three people: me, my husband, and our son. Both my husband and I work during the week. I am a doctor and he is a teacher. We both work near our house and need to get to our offices in the morning and come back home at night. Our son goes to school every day and plays sports and sees his friends after school. A car would help us get to all these places quickly and easily. For a while now, we have been taking buses to travel. This was fine before my son went to school. Taking a bus does not cost very much money. Buying a bus pass is less expensive than paying for gas for a car. Cars also need to be repaired and maintained which costs money too. Riding the bus is hard, though, because we do not have personal control over it. The bus travels on its set route, and it is sometimes late or slow. It doesn\u0027t run all the time, especially at night. Riding the bus makes it hard to change our plans. So we are thinking about getting a car. How do we choose what kind of car to get? And how do we get it? We have a few options. One is to lease a car, which means to rent it for a period of time. This is good because it is a little cheaper than buying a car, and we won\u0027t have to own it forever. But the downside is that the car won\u0027t be ours, and if we keep it for very long, it will end up being more expensive than if we had bought a car. The other option is buying a car, which we would have until the car stops working or we decide to sell it. If we buy a car, we will have to decide whether to get a new or used car. A new car will probably be better than a used car and will last longer than a used car. It will be more expensive, though. A used car, on the other hand, may be cheaper, but it will probably not last as long. Also, a used car is usually more likely to break and need repairs, which could be very expensive. The decision will have to come down to how much money we want to spend and how long we want to keep our car. We also need to consider what we will use the car for. Day to day, we need the car to get to and from work and school. We will also use it to run errands and do things like buying groceries, going to the doctor, or going out to eat at restaurants. We also like to travel and visit our family, some of whom live far away. Visiting them can sometimes mean long trips, and we might want to take suitcases with us. This means that we will need a car that has enough space to carry our things. We also live in a place where it is rainy in the summer time and snowy in the winter time, so we will need a car that can drive in rain and snow. If we got a car that would slide around or get stuck in bad weather, we would not be able to drive at all if the weather were bad. This would be bad for us, as we want to drive any time that we need to. Whether we decide to lease or buy, choose new or used, we will have a car to drive. As a family, we need to weigh our options and decide what is best for us. "

        "text": "Maggie pulled her red hat over her head as she stepped into the cold. Her brother, Jamie, had taken Maggie to her favorite diner after school to get a cup of hot chocolate. As they sipped their warm treats, Maggie told Jamie about her homework. Her teacher had asked Maggie\u0027s class to brainstorm community service projects the class could do together. When it started to get dark outside, they headed back home. Yuck, she thought as her rain boot landed in a big puddle of slush. January was not her favorite month in New York City. It was cold and wet, and she could hardly play outside! She dreamt of her warm bed as a cold wind whipped past her. The block was empty, the two were the only pair walking down the snowy sidewalk. Well, at least that\u0027s what Maggie thought. All of a sudden, out of the corner of her eye, she saw something move. Maggie stopped in her tracks. She looked toward the source of the movement in curiosity. A bundle of blankets was plied on top of several cardboard pieces that had been placed over the sidewalk. Maggie stepped closer. She didn\u0027t see any movement anymore. But then, out of the blankets emerged a man. He wore an old, ragged jacket, it looked like one Maggie had seen in movies, the kind that soldiers wear. There were holes in the elbows. On his hands he wore dirty black gloves, and the fabric for the thumb on the right hand had been torn off. \"Hello!\" Maggie said, wishing she had more blankets for him. \"Well hello, could you help a fellow out?\" he replied in a deep voice. \"Oh, I don\u0027t have anything...\" Maggie said, as she felt around her pockets. Jamie pulled out a dollar bill from his wallet and placed it in the man\u0027s hands. \"Thank you so much,\" he said. Maggie and Jamie smiled at him and kept on walking. 0nce they arrived home, Maggie told her dad about the man on the street. He was busy preparing dinner. \"It\u0027s really ha rd for them out there, especially during the winter months. The homeless shelters in the city don\u0027t have enough room for everyone,\" he told her. Her dad went back to cooking, but Maggie couldn\u0027t stop thinking about the man. During dinner, she remained quiet and thought about what she could do to help those without a home. She figured it would be perfect for her class\u0027s community service project. Once she finished eating, she rushed to the computer to do some research. She found the in January 2013. It said that 610,042 Americans were homeless on am; given night. That meant one in 514 people. Maggie could hardly; wrap her head around that number. She tried to look up different homeless shelters around New York City. She clicked on a link. \"The Bowery Mission, Rebuilding Lives Since 1379,\" Maggie read aloud. The Bowery Mission is an organization that provides meals, shelter, and services to the underserved population. \"Jamie!\" she called out. \"I found something that we can do!\" As he started to walk toward her, she excitedly told him about the volunteer opportunities at the Bowen; Mission. They could sign up to serve meals to the homeless. \"Last year, the volunteers were able to provide more than 382,400 meals to the homeless in New York City!\" Maggie said, pointing to the computer screen. She looked up information on how to volunteer to tell her teacher the next day. The; could help prepare meals, serve them, and clean up afterward. And the next time Maggie walked down the block, she packed a granola bar and a banana to give to the man she\u0027d seen on the street. "

        "title": "Animals of the Tropical Rainforest",
        "author": "",
        "metadata": "Grade: 4 Lexile: 1180L",
        "text": "Where can you find more animal species than anywhere else in the world? It\u0027s not a zoo or the circus. It\u0027s a very special type of ecosystem called a rainforest, and most rainforests can be found in tropical climates in the Southern Hemisphere. Why are rainforests only found in certain parts of the globe? Let\u0027s start with geography. A \"hemisphere\" is a half of the earth, so the Northern Hemisphere is the northern half and the Southern Hemisphere is the southern half of Earth. They are divided by a line called the equator. The Northern Hemisphere starts just above the equator and ends at the Arctic Circle. The Southern Hemisphere starts just below the equator and ends at the South Pole in Antarctica. The two most common climates in the Southern Hemisphere, temperate and tropical, both have lots of precipitation. The difference is that temperate climates have warm summers and cold winters, while tropical climates are warm all year long. Because there\u0027s lots of rain and the temperature stays at about 75-85 degrees Fahrenheit year round, rainforests in tropical climates have optimal conditions for many animal species. Rainforest animals don\u0027t have to worry about freezing during the winter or finding shade in the summer. Plus, because it rains almost every day, animals rarely have to search for water. This makes tropical rainforests a suitable home for many species, from massive gorillas to tiny ants. In addition to their tropical climates, another reason why rainforests are home to so many different types of animals is because they are some of the oldest ecosystems on earth. Scientists think that some rainforests have been around since dinosaurs roamed the earth at least 100 million years ago. One of the rainforests in the world is the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. Jaguars, toucans, parrots, gorillas, and tarantulas all call it home. Yet this is only a small sample of rainforest animals. Many other rare and often endangered animals can be found in rainforests, like the okapi. This beautiful creature has striped hindquarters and front legs like a zebra. Okapis also have tall perky ears, like a giraffe, and they mostly live in the Ituri rainforest of Central Africa. In fact, there are so many different types of animals in tropical rainforests that we haven\u0027t been able to name all the species yet. Rainforests are also home to some animals you might want to avoid, like flying snakes (although their name is actually a misnomer since they can only glide and not gain altitude) and spiders that eat birds. Other rainforest animals, like the coral snake and the poison arrow frog, produce natural poison that protects them from harm. Get too close, and they could easily harm you with poison. Many of these species are endemic to tropical rainforests, meaning that rainforests are the only place they live on earth. Some species have had to adapt to their surroundings in the rainforest in order to survive. For example, toucans and parrots both have very large, strong beaks. These powerful beaks make it easy for them to crack open the tough shells of nuts that grow on many rainforest trees. Birds with small beaks, like robins and sparrows living in the Northern Hemisphere, probably would not be able to survive in the rainforest without being able to crack open hard nuts. Another way animals adapt to life in the rainforest is by camouflaging themselves to hide from predators. An insect called the \"walking stick\" lives in the palm tree, and it blends in so well with it that it\u0027s practically unnoticeable unless it moves. When some butterflies close their wings, they look identical to leaves, which masks them from predators. Despite the biodiversity in the rainforests of the Southern Hemisphere, many species are quickly becoming extinct, as people cut down trees and destroy natural habitats. Other threats to species of the rainforest include illegally trading monkeys to sell them as pets and killing jaguars for their highly valued skins. Pollution from mining has killed many types of fish as well. Because of the unique tropical climate in rainforests of the Southern Hemisphere, the animals within these ecosystems most likely cannot survive elsewhere if their habitats are destroyed. It\u0027s crucial to take care of our planet, especially the rainforests, so that these animals can continue to thrive. "

        "metadata": "Grade: 4 Lexile: 930",
        "text": "Glaciers are large masses of ice that can be found in either the oceans or on land. These large bodies of frozen water have big effects on the formation of different parts of the world, especially valleys. Valleys were formed during the Ice Age, a time where many places were cold and covered with ice. As the Ice Age ended, the glaciers began to melt. As they did, they left behind unique land formations. Glaciers are formed from large amounts of snow and ice. Because the Ice Age was a time of freezing temperatures, glaciers became very common in many parts of the world. They were especially common in North America and Europe. As these masses of ice grew, they began to cover large areas of land. Some glaciers came together to form bigger ones, just like different streams of waterjoin to form bigger rivers. As they slowly moved, these massive glaciers began to shape the landscape. Glaciers shape the landscape during a process called erosion. Erosion is the result of the friction of wind, water, or, in this case, ice against rocks and soil. Glaciers changed many landscapes, leaving behind waterfalls and moraines, which are very rocky landscapes created by glacial debris. They created places that had U-shapes, or valleys. Valleys have very steep, high land ranges with flat land in the middle. They are very common in North America and northern Europe. Yosemite National Park in California is one of the most famous valleys in the world. Other famous valleys are in Scotland and Austria. But these landscapes could not be seen until thousands of years ago, when the Ice Age came to an end and the earth started to naturally warm up. As temperatures began to rise, some of the glaciers melted, and the U-shaped valleys began to appear. Most of these valleys had existed before the Ice Age, but they had a V-shape, because they had been created through erosion by water flowing in rivers. But the glaciers made these valleys wider and sometimes left behind wider rivers filled with fresh water. Although the Ice Age ended 10,000 years ago, there are still many glaciers in the world. Most of them are found in Antarctica and Greenland, but there are glaciers on nearly every continent. Today many glaciers are either breaking apart or melting. Some scientists say this could be because of climate change caused by humans. Just as they did thousands of years ago, glaciers change the landscape of many places. Many geologists are keeping an eye on these melting glaciers to see how the earth may be affected by them. "

        "text": "Becky had everything Sarah wanted: a pool in her backyard, popularity, and new clothes. Worse, it seemed (at least to Sarah) that Becky had the Midas touch. Everything she touched turned to gold. She won the class lottery and with it $50! She guessed how many jelly beans were in the jar in the yearly guess-how-many contest and won all 768 of them. She won every race she entered, every art competition, and every award the school offered. She had all the luck in the world. Sarah was an only child. She wore hand-me-downs from her older cousin Clementine. She didn\u0027t have many friends. Her best friend Kiara was really the best in a lot of ways: kind, generous, and loyal. Just the kind of person you would want for a best friend. But Sarah most certainly did not have good luck. She never won anything. On the days she carried an umbrella, it never rained; on the days she forgot her umbrella, dark rain clouds seemed to follow her around. One rainy day in April, though, Sarah and Becky swapped luck. That\u0027s how Sarah thought of it, anyway. It wasn\u0027t expected, and it certainly wasn\u0027t planned. But after weeks of wishing for it, Sarah woke up and things felt different. She felt lucky. She rolled out of bed and noticed a small package on her desk. She opened it: it was a brand new dress, the same one she had been eyeing for weeks. \"Mom!\" she called. \"Did you get me this dress?\" \"It\u0027s from your grandmother,\" her mother called back. \"Early birthday gift!\" Sarah shrugged. Her birthday wasn\u0027t until August. \"And I made your favorite! Chocolate chip pancakes!\" her mother shouted. \"Pancakes on a Wednesday?\" This truly was a different kind of day. And it didn\u0027t stop there. On the school bus, Carlos, the most popular boy in school, saved her a seat. Then Mrs. Nelson picked her, yes, her!, to take care of the class rabbit over the weekend. The cafeteria lady gave her two extra cookies and said with a wink, \"Your lucky day!\" But the best part of the day was art class. Mr. Rodriguez, her art teacher, walked around the room slowly. Sarah hadn\u0027t spent much time on her project. But it was still pretty, still unique. Mr. Rodriguez walked past Becky\u0027s art project and didn\u0027t even pause. Becky looked devastated. Her hair was still wet from that morning\u0027s rain. She had forgotten to bring an umbrella. \"Well, c|ass Mr. Rodriguez said. \"I think our winner for this month is Sarah! Excellent work, Sarah, this shows a lot of progress!\" Sarah smiled proudly. \"Guess you have some competition,\" she whispered to Becky. Sarah was on top of the world. She didn\u0027t feel like a normal fourth grader at all. Today, she felt like a better-than-average fourth grader, possibly the best fourth grader who had ever existed. She wondered what was next. Becky, she noticed, had spent most of the day sulking. \"Let someone else have a shot at being lucky for once,\" Sarah thought to herself. Then she noticed that Becky was crying. Small tears dripped down onto her t-shirt. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Sarah asked. \"I just spent a lot of time on that project,\" Becky said between hiccupped sobs. Sarah was beginning to feel awful. After all, she hadn\u0027t spent much time on her project at all. Then she felt Kiara tap her on the shoulder. \"You know, Sarah,\" Kiara started. She looked angry and hurt at the same time. \"You haven\u0027t been very nice today. You\u0027ve been acting like...like you\u0027re the best person in the world.\" She shook her head. \"This just isn\u0027t like you at all.\" Now Sarah felt even worse. It was one thing to have the class pet dislike you, but another thing entirely to disappoint your best friend. \"I\u0027m sorry, Kiara,\" she said. \"It\u0027s just been a weird day.\" She walked over to Becky and gave her a hug. \"Don\u0027t worry,\" she whispered,\"your luck will change soon enough.\" Luck, Sarah was beginning to think, was overrated.

        "text": "What happens when you\u0027re standing in one spot, and you want to visit a different spot, but there\u0027s water in the way? That\u0027s the problem people faced for hundreds of years in the area that is now New York City. In New York City, there is a tidal strait called the Narrows, which connects Upper New York Bay with Lower New York Bay. On one side of the water is Brooklyn. 0n the other side is Staten Island. The Narrows is the place where Brooklyn and Staten Island come closest to touching. But the Narrows isn\u0027t really so narrow. The water is almost a mile wide; and it\u0027s more than 100 feet deep. For a long time that wasn\u0027t a problem, because only a few people lived in Brooklyn and Staten Island. When they wanted to talk to each other. they climbed into their boats and sailed across. By the 1800s, people were very annoyed with the Narrows. Lots of people had to travel between Staten Island and Brooklyn to get from their homes to their jobs. Taking a boat every time was very slow and expensive, and in bad weather the ferries couldn\u0027t sail at all. In 1888, the Baltimore \u0026 Ohio Railroad announced it would dig a tunnel under the water for freight trains. Tunnels cost a lot of money to build, though, so that plan didn\u0027t work. Then in the early 1920s, New York\u0027s leaders decided to build a tunnel so that subway trains could carry people under the Narrows. They paid workers and started digging the tunnel, but the job was too expensive, and they gave up. Other people wanted to cross the Narrows by building a bridge. In 1910 Charles Worthington proposed a bridge that would hang 260 feet above the water. Six years later, an engineer named David Steinman proposed a taller bridge. But leaders of the military feared the bridges could block big Navy ships entering New York Harbor. So neither bridge was built. Finally, after World War II, there were so many people living in New York City that leaders decided Brooklyn and Staten Island needed a direct connection. Since tunnels were so expensive, they decided to build a bridge. They hired engineer Othmar Ammann to design it. Ammann decided the bridge should have two separate roadways stacked on top of each other. Both roadways would hang in the air from thick steel cables, supported by two giant steel towers. Construction took five years, employed 12,000 workers, and cost $320 million. The bridge was named after the first European who sailed there, Giovanni da Verrazano. He explored America in 1524. When the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened in 1964, it was the longest of its kind in the world. About 190,000 cars and trucks travel the bridge every day. Sometimes getting from one place to another is easy. You simply walk there. Other times it can be quite hard. In New York, people tried to solve the problem of crossing the Narrows by sailing boats, digging tunnels, and dreaming of bridges. Figuring out a good solution took 440 years."

        "text": "Everyone knows that kicking a soccer ball causes it to roll across the grass. But what makes this happen? What is required to make the ball move faster? What\u0027s the difference, in other words, between passing the soccer ball to a teammate and shooting for the goal? Kicking a ball may seem simple, but physicists spent years trying to figure out why objects move the way they do. What they discovered is that kicking a soccer ball requires applying force to the surface of the ball. The greater the force, the faster the ball will go, and the further it will travel. How much force you apply to the ball, that is, will often determine whether you score a goal or not. The combination of force and distance equals what is called \"work.\" In this case, we don\u0027t mean the noun form of work, like a job. We are talking about work as a verb, as a form of action. Work can be taking out the trash or cleaning dishes in your house. Furniture movers work by carrying chairs and tables out of one apartment and into another. If the first apartment is on the second floor and the second apartment is on the fourth floor, carrying the furniture into the second apartment will require about twice as much work as the first. Keep in mind that force and work are not the same things as energy. Energy comes in several forms. But the best way to understand it is as something that creates the ability to do work. When someone says, \"I don\u0027t have any energy,\" what do they usually mean? Often, they mean they don\u0027t have the strength or motivation to work. Without energy, it is hard to play soccer or lift furniture. In fact, it may even be difficult to get out of bed. Energy is what allows us to do work. The more energy we have, the more work we can do. Mathematicians use the following simple equation to define the meaning of work: force x distance \u003d work. The heavier an object is, in other words, the more force it exerts in the form of gravity. Picking an anvil up off the ground requires more energy than picking up a feather. If you\u0027re interested in building muscles, though, keep in mind that lifting heavier things will make you stronger over time. And the stronger you are, the more likely you are to win at soccer. "

        "text": "David and Charlie were setting off on a hiking trip with their uncle Max. They had packed all of the essential items they would need for their day of hiking. Inside their backpacks were sandwiches, water, sunscreen, bug spray, a long sleeve shirt for the cold, and sunglasses for the sun. Before they started on their trip, they gathered around a picnic table with their uncle. He showed them what was inside his own backpack. His bag was heavier. He had all the same things David and Charlie had in their bags except he also had a first aid kit, extra water bottles, a flashlight and a bunch of folded papers. \"What is with all the papers, Uncle Max?\" asked David. \"Are you going to be doing some homework at the top of the mountain?\" Uncle Max and the boys laughed. \"No,\" said Uncle Max, spreading out the folded papers. \"These are all maps. They will show us where we are headed.\" \"Why don\u0027t you just look up the map on your phone?\" asked Charlie. \"Well, we can do that too,\" said Uncle Max. \"But just in case the phone battery dies or we lose service, we will have these maps on paper. Plus a few of these maps show specific trails for the park that may not be listed on your phone.\" Uncle Max opened one of the maps even wider and pointed to a spot with his finger. \"This is where we are,\" he said. \"See all of the trees around us? And this is the trail we are going to take up the mountain and then back.\" Uncle Max pointed at a mountain to the right. Sure enough it was on the map in the same spot. The boys adjusted their bags, tied their shoes tight, and started off down the trail following behind Uncle Max. \"How do the people who make the maps know where everything is?\" asked Charlie. \"Well, there is something called Cartography,\" said Uncle Max. \"Cartography is the study and making of maps. Cartographers use science and exploration to establish where certain parts of the Earth are.\" Uncle Max and the boys hiked around a bunch of trees and followed a path over a small river. \"Do maps tell you about what is under the water too?\" asked David. \"Some of them do,\" said Uncle Max. \"Not all maps show all bodies of water. But bigger bodies of water like oceans and lakes are often mapped out. If you are exploring in the ocean and you want to find some coral reef or a sunken ship, then that would be included on a map.\" The three walked for another hour. As they went, they looked at all the trees and plants. They also saw a deer and a few frogs. After a few more minutes, the boys stopped and had some water, while Uncle Max showed them where they were on the map. They were almost at the bottom of the mountain, they could see it right up in front of them. \"In school we learned that the Earth\u0027s surface moves,\" said David, as they started walking again. \"Because the Earth is made up of plates.\" \"Plates?\" asked Charlie. \"Like the plates we use to eat lunch?\" Uncle Max laughed. \"Sort of,\" he said. \"More like puzzle pieces that fit together. And yes, they do move, but usually they move very slowly. If you look at maps that scientists have created of what the Earth looked like many, many years ago, you can see that countries and islands on the Earth were in different places. Land masses broke apart and floated.\" \"So then maps change,\" said Charlie. \"Yes, they have to be updated to reflect any changes,\" said Uncle Max. \"Not that those changes happen very fast.\" \"Earthquakes happen fast, though,\" said David. \"Definitely,\" said Uncle Max. \"Very fast. An earthquake is the result of a sudden release of energy in the Earth\u0027s crust that creates something called seismic waves. That is why the machine used to measure an earthquake is called a seismometer. This machine helps scientists figure out what is going on in the Earth and helps predict any future earthquakes, since they sometimes come in patterns.\" \"That\u0027s scary,\" said Charlie.\"It is. But that shows you how powerful the Earth\u0027s movements can be,\" said Uncle Max. The three hikers reached the mountain. David looked up. \"We are going all the way up there?\" he asked. He was tired from his first hike and was not looking forward to heading up the mountain. Uncle Max laughed. \"How about we have our sandwiches down here instead,\" he suggested. \"Then we can go back and swim in the lake.\" The boys agreed. So Uncle Max laid a blanket on a big flat rock, and the three had their sandwiches in the sun. Then they took a photo in front of the mountain, so they could show their mom. Maybe next time they came back, they could use the map to climb the mountain. "

        "text": "The Young Scout troop went on a camping trip one weekend. The 12 boys and their patrol leader went into the woods close to their home city of Sacramento, located in the state of California, U.S.A. They had many activities planned. The boys were going to learn about pitching tents, cooking on a fire, wood carving, and, because there was a river close by, panning. Panning is simple and has a long history. It has been used for centuries to find rocks, minerals, and riches in riverbeds. All a person has to do is dip a large pan into a river, allow water, dirt, and stones to collect in it, and then shake. The pan can either have tiny holes or lengthy slits that will allow the water to escape, while leaving the rocks behind. There is always a chance that one of those rocks might actually be very valuable. One might even be a golden nugget! The patrol leader had brought along six pans for the fun learning experience, so the boys worked in pairs. For a time, the boys went through the panning process and looked closely at the rocks they found. As they dipped and shook, then dipped and shook their pans some more, their patrol leader explained to them that panning for gold was in part responsible for one of the most important times in American history. And though a lot of people found riches in California, the gold rush of the mid-1800s also destroyed one man\u0027s fortune. That man\u0027s name was John Sutter. Sutter had traveled to America from his home country of Switzerland after having a lot of trouble making money there. He left his wife and children in Switzerland, while he moved around the western part of the U.S. hoping to find a way to earn money. After years of effort, his work finally paid off. He was able to build \"Sutter\u0027s Fort\" close to where the city of Sacramento lies today in the year of 1841. Native Americans helped him build it, and the fort became a rather large farm and orchard. He was able to give jobs to many people who were coming into the area from the eastern parts of the U.S. as well as some local Native Americans. In 1847, Sutter was hoping to increase his wealth, and he began construction on a sawmill. A sawmill is a place where large tree trunks are cut down to make useful lumber. In January of 1848, the mill was almost complete when one of his workers came to him with a discovery that changed the United States forever. In a nearby river, James W. Marshall found gold. He told his boss, Sutter, about it. Sutter felt that this discovery was actually a bad thing for him, and he was right. Sutter and Marshall tried to keep the gold a secret, but people eventually found out. This first affected Sutter because many of his workers just stopped working for him and began searching for gold. Then, thousands upon thousands of people from the Eastern U.S., Mexico, and even Asia invaded the area, hoping to strike it rich. Many of these people were poor and desperate, so they were willing to make the long, dangerous trip to California from wherever they lived. A lot of them used the panning process in rivers to find gold because it was inexpensive and did not require large machines or explosives. Many moved there in the year of 1849 and were then called \u002749ers. The nearby city of San Francisco grew tremendously, eventually becoming one of the biggest cities in the country. Roads were built so that people could get into the area. New laws were written, and, by September 1850, California was named the 31st state in the United States of America - one main reason being that so many people had moved there for gold. Though some people struck it rich, Sutter was ruined. Nobody would work for him, and many people who came into the area stole from his farm and orchard. Soon, he would leave California and try his luck living in Pennsylvania. None of the Young Scouts found any gold in the river during their camping trip. However, they heard quite a history lesson from their patrol leader about a really exciting time in history. "

        "text": "Someone has been stealing from the community garden. Micky and Marnie want to find out who it is. Micky and Marnie are brother and sister. They live in Irvine, California and volunteer at the community garden. Every day after school, they water the squash and the lettuce. They work hard and watch the trees grow. The vegetables are donated to food banks, so people don\u0027t go hungry. Today, the food started to disappear. Marnie is the first to notice. She starts to water the squash like she always does. But instead of a plot of squash, there is only an empty hole. \"The...the...squash Marnie stammers. \"The squash has been squashed !\" says Micky.\"We have to tell an adult!\" Across the field, they spot their neighbor, Hank. Hank is 80 years old and moving very slowly. Hank has trouble hearing. \"Hank, Hank! Someone is stealing vegetables!\" \"Eh? I can\u0027t hear ya,\" he says, putting his hand to his ear.\"Someone stole all the squash!\" says Marnie. \"Eh? Someone scalded the wash?\" \"There\u0027s a thief!\" \"I\u0027m no chief!\" Hank says. \"Now get back to work, ya slackers!\" \"Hank can\u0027t hear a word we\u0027re saying!\" says Micky. He kicks a rock with his foot. Thud! A small rabbit comes out from underneath some lettuce. The rabbit is rubbing his head. The rabbit gives them a mean look and then hops away. His white, fluffy tail is shining in the sun. \"If I didn\u0027t know better, I\u0027d think that rabbit is mad at you,\" says Marnie. Micky and Marnie walk away with their heads low. Missing squash and an angry rabbit? This day is going terribly. They get on their bikes and ride home along the bike path. The wind is in their hair, and it feels like they are flying. For a moment, they forget all about the missing vegetables. The sun is starting to set in the sky when they finally get back home. They are late for dinner. \"I told you to be home at 5:00!\" Mom says. \"But Mom! There\u0027s a thief at the garden! He stole our squash!\" \"Missing squash, you say?\" she says. \"Well, wasn\u0027t the squash your responsibility?\" \"Uh, I guess so,\" says Marnie. \"It is our responsibility to water it!\" \"Then it\u0027s your responsibility if someone steals it. It\u0027s also your responsibility to get home on time.\" Marnie looks down at her plate and lets out a large gasp. Her plate is filled with yellow squash. Micky and Marnie look at each other. \"You don\u0027t think Mom could be the squash thief, do you?\" asks Marnie. \"Geez, I sure hope not,\" says Micky. There\u0027s so much squash on their plates, they aren\u0027t sure what to believe. The next day, they go back to the garden. Again, no one else is there except old Hank. This time, there are two empty plots. Now all the broccoli is missing, too. \"This is outrageous cries Marnie. \"We are the only people who know this is happening! But no one will listen to us because we\u0027re kids!\" \"It\u0027s not fair being a kid,\" says Micky. \"Everybody thinks we\u0027re making up stories.\"Micky kicks a rock again. Once again, the rock goes under some lettuce. THUD! Another rabbit comes out, rubbing his head. \"What on earth...\" says Micky. \"How could I possibly hit the same rabbit twice in two days?\" The rabbit turns and hops away, showing a fluffy, black tail. \"Wait. That rabbit yesterday had a white tail. This rabbit has a black one. This is a different rabbit!\" \"Follow him!\" The two siblings chase the rabbit. As they run, other rabbits appear from their hiding spots in the lettuce. Soon, there are hundreds of rabbits. Micky and Marnie are no longer chasing one rabbit. Now, they are being chased by the rabbits! Rabbits in front! Rabbits behind! \"Run away from the rabbits!\" yells Marnie. \"How? They\u0027re everywhere!\" \"Make a quick right! Jump! Now!\" Marnie says. Theyjump to the right. The rabbits keep running right by them. The siblings hide underneath a patch of green beans. \"Look!\" Micky says, pointing straight ahead. The rabbits are still running. The rabbits are also stealing. As they run, they grab stalks of leafy greens in their mouths. This is daylight robbery! \"I guess we found our thieves,\" Marnie says. \"And it\u0027s not Mom!\" \"Unless Mom is a rabbit!\" says Micky. \"It\u0027s too bad we\u0027re kids. No one will believe us.\" Marnie says. \"Ahem!\" A loud voice echoes above them. \"I believe you.\" Old Hank is standing there. He saw the whole thing. \"Now do you see, Hank?\" asks Marnie. \"I may be deaf, but I ain\u0027t blind,\" says Hank. \"I admit I thought it was you kids who were stealing those vegetables. I\u0027ve been trying to catch you in the act! But now I see the truth. It\u0027s these rabbits!\" \"We know who the real thieves are!\" says Micky. \"We need to protect our vegetables.\" \"That\u0027s true,\" says Hank. \"The rabbits certainly are flexible.\" \"No!\" says Micky and Marnie. \"The vegetables!\" \"Respectable?\" asks Hank. \"The garden!\" the children yell at the top of their lungs. \"The varmints? They\u0027re not respectable! They steal!\" \"We need to build afence!\" yells Mickey. \"Learn to dance?\" asks Hank. \"I\u0027m not teaching you how to dance! We need to build a fence!\" \"Oh, forget it!\" says Marnie. \"Forget it? That\u0027s right,\" says Hank. \"Now quit dancing and let\u0027s build a fence!\" \"Tomorrow!\" the kids say. \"We\u0027ve done quite enough for today!\" Micky and Marnie get on their bikes and ride home. For the time being, they forget all about the vegetable thieves and the naughty rabbits. They are flying through the air. "

        "text": "Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world. it is located in the country of Nepal. It is 8,348 meters tall. This means it isjust over five-and-a half miles in height. Until 1953, nobody had successfully climbed Mount Everest, though many had tried. Mount Everest has steep slopes. Many climbers have slipped and fallen to their deaths. The mountain is very windy. Parts of it are covered with snow. Many mountaineers would get caught in snowstorms and be unable to climb. The mountain is rocky. Sometimes, during snowstorms, rocks would tumble down the slopes of the mountain. Any climbers trying to go up the mountain might be risking their lives. There is also very little oxvgen atop Mount Everest. This is because the oxygen in the air reduces as we go higher. This means that it is difficult for climbers to breathe. The climbers have to take oxygen in cylinders to breathe which means thev have to carry extra weight on their backs. This slows them down. In 1953, a New Zealand-based climber, Edmund Hillarv, and a Nepalese climber, Tenzing Norgay, climbed Mount Everest for the first time. They both took photographs on the peak. They then buried some sweets on the peak, as a gesture to celebrate their climb. But they could not stay; for long, because it was windy and snowv. They soon came down. Later, many people asked Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay which of them had reached the peak first. They both said it was a team effort; it didn\u0027t matter because they had gone together. After Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, many other climbers went up the mountain. In 1975, Jun ko Tabei became the first woman to climb Mount Everest. In 1980, Reinhold Messner became the first man to climb the mountain alone. Until then, climbers had always gone up the mountain in teams. The team members would help fix ropes, set up camps, and make food. But Reinhold Messner went alone to the top. Reinhold Messner was a great climber. Back in 1978, he had climbed Everest without carrying anv extra oxygen. He\u0027d said that it was \"man against the mountain.\" In recent years, many have climbed Mount Everest. As of 2010, 3,142 people had climbed the mountain. Many climbers fly to the city of Kathmandu in Nepal. In Kathmandu, many see the Royal Palace. They can buy Everest-themed T-shirts, books, and CDs. Once climbers are settled in Kathmandu, they meet local guides called Sherpas. The Sherpas are Nepali men who have grown up in the mountains. They are experts at climbing. They are also phvsically very strong. The Sherpas give climbers bags, ropes, tents, and other equipment. As of 2013, this equipment cost almost $8,000. The climbers also buy oxygen cylinders, which can cost $3,000. Once the climbers have all their luggage, they go to a location called Base Camp. From Base Camp, thev climb up Mount Everest. "

        "author": "ReadWorks",
        "metadata": "Grade: 4 Lexile: 1040",
        "text": "By the time California became an American state in 1850, it was already an important place for farming. Miners, ranchers, and farmers had been settling there for decades due to the state\u0027s many types of geography. California had a population of about 90,000 in 1850, and this grew to over 5 million by 1930. By the 20th century, California produced a lot of the nation\u0027s fruits, vegetables, and other crops. When severe drought hit the Great Plains in the 1930s, many sought refuge in California. Migrant laborers arrived in the United States with no work, and their families often went hungry. This disastrous time was captured by newspaper reporters, but it also lives on in history through novels and photographs. Two Californians in particular were exceptional at recording this hard period. John Steinbeck was born in Salinas, California, in 1902. He attended Stanford University, also in California, though he did not graduate. Eventually he moved to New York to become a writer, but he did not manage to get a career off the ground. He returned to his home state, where he started to write fiction about California and its people. Many of Steinbeck\u0027s most famous novels and short stories were written in the 1930s during America\u0027s Great Depression. Even though they are fictional, his subjects often show what was happening in history at the time. His book Tortilla Flat focused on people living in the countryside in Monterey, California. Tortilla Flat is a funny story about a group of friends mostly enjoying themselves, but Steinbeck\u0027s later books dealt with more serious issues. In Dubious Battle, which the writer published in 1936, looks at migrant laborers who picked fruit in California\u0027s orchards. The workers were striking for better working conditions. Steinbeck also used his work to show the life and hardships faced by California\u0027s migrant ranch workers. Of Mice and Men is his story of two such workers, Lennie and George, who make their way from one town to another in California looking for work. Their dream is to own their own land one day, but many obstacles make this difficult to achieve. Finally, Steinbeck\u0027s most famous novel about Californians is The Grapes of Wrath, published in 1939. Like some of Steinbeck\u0027s other stories, the book shows people facing poverty and hardship during the Great Depression. In the novel, a family of tenant farmers, the Joads, moves from Oklahoma to California after a drought leaves them too poor to farm. They are forced to become migrant laborers in order to survive. Steinbeck\u0027s novels showed fictional versions ofthe very real problems people in California faced during the 1930s. In contrast, the photographs of Dorothea Lange offer real-life examples of hardship. Lange was born in New Jersey in 1895. As a young adult, she settled in San Francisco, California. She had decided in high school to become a photographer, and at first, she ran her own studio, where she took people\u0027s portraits. During the 1920s, Lange traveled with her first husband, Maynard Dixon, around the southwestern United States. She began to take pictures of people and places in what is called \"documentary style photography,\" because ofthe way it documents people\u0027s lives. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, she began to take many more photos of the poor in order to illustrate the many problems they faced. She started with what she saw right in San Francisco and took pictures of striking laborers and people waiting on bread lines. In 1934, Lange started working for the California State Emergency Relief Administration. The next year, she began to work as a photographer for the Resettlement Administration. Lange worked with her second husband, Paul Taylor, who wrote reports on migrant farm workers while Lange took the photos. In 1936, Lange took what became her most famous picture. \"Migrant Mother\" shows a woman staring away from the camera, two of her seven children next to her. They are hiding their faces. Everyone is hungry. The family is stuck in a pea-pickers\u0027 camp in California. They sold the tires on their car in order to buy food. Conditions at the migrant workers\u0027 camps were terrible. After Lange put the photo in a newspaper in San Francisco, the government stepped in to make sure no one at the camp starved. Without Lange and her work, conditions there could have been very different. While we have history books to remind us ofwhat took place in California and across the country during the Great Depression, photos and fiction can serve this purpose, too. Steinbeck\u0027s novels and Lange\u0027s photographs, showing specific people and events from that time period, have made a lasting impression on how we view the events of 1930s California. "

        "text": "Becky Baumwoll never forgets her lines. That\u0027s partly because there aren\u0027t any lines in the plays she performs. Becky and her theater company, Broken Box, tell stories without using words. They wear white face paint and dress in black. Their plays are performed on an empty stage and without any props. But when the show begins, the empty stage suddenly looks like a desert, a castle, a forest, or a dining room. Without changing her costume, Becky transforms from a wiry old ogre, to a sparrow, to a cup full ofJell-O. Though her hands are empty, she seems to be holding a sword, a can of beans, or the reins of a horse. How can this happen? Are we under a spell? Does Becky know magic? Becky is a kind of actor called a mime. Ever since she was in college, Becky has been practicing and perfecting her art. A mime tells stories silently and creates objects and landscapes using just his or her body. \"If we\u0027re telling a story about fighting a dragon,\" Becky explains, \"we can\u0027t say, \u0027LOOK THERE\u0027S A DRAGON OVER THERE!\u0027 We have to come up with ways to show the audience there\u0027s a dragon, by either making one out of mimes like a big moving sculpture, or miming an invisible one.\" It\u0027s not quite magic, but close. Becky and her company of mimes know how to excite the imagination of their audience. The audience\u0027s imagination provides the stories with words, props, costumes, and stage sets. \"The audience can imagine a more amazing dragon than we would ever be able to describe with words.\" Becky knows that everyone has an incredible imagination. Broken Box help us use ours. Our imagination is where the magic comes from. Sometimes the mimes are so successful that members of the audience can forget that the props and scenes are imaginary. When Becky was in college, she performed a story about a guardian angel. The angel, who was played by another mime named Tasha Milkman, wants to become a human being, and to do that she has to tear off her wings. \"About a week after our performance,\" Becky says, \"Tasha\u0027s friend called her and asked if she could borrow Tasha\u0027s angel wings for a project she was doing. She had forgotten they were mimed!\" Some stories are very difficult to tell in mime. \"Watching a play in mime is like piecing together a puzzle,\" Becky explains. \"The audience has to follow every gesture and movement to understand what\u0027s going on.\" The mimes practice and practice to make all of their movements perfect; otherwise the audience might not know what to imagine. Once, Broken Box performed a play about a fortune-teller at a carnival. They had a great story, but how could they ever get the audience to imagine the carnival? \"A carnival is a very specific place. It\u0027s busy and bustling, outdoors, big, dirty, bright, and loud.\" They didn\u0027t have nearly enough actors to portray all the people in the crowd, and since they couldn\u0027t shout, they couldn\u0027t make the stage very loud. Finally, they found a solution: \"We had the main characters walk back and forth on the stage, and every time they walked, the rest of the mimes behind them would make a new group pose around a different carnival act: a strongman, a sword- swallower, and performing sisters.\" The audience imagined a bustling carnival full of people. It was so noisy we could hardly hear what the characters were saying! Though Becky claims to not know magic, she does know how to conjure things out of thin air. Once, when she was very sad, she created a story about a woman who is so sad she can hardly stand. A second mime played the part of the woman\u0027s soul. In the play, the soul tries very hard to help make the woman feel better, pushing her with all her might. Finally the soul succeeds in helping the woman stand. After weeks of working on the performance, Becky started to feel less sad. Creating the performance made her feel better. In a way, mime is magical. \"It\u0027s like I created my own medicine.\" "

He glanced with rapid eyes That hurried all abroad, , They looked like frightened beads, I thought; He stirred his velvet head Like one in danger; cautious, I offered him a crumb, And he unrolled his feathers  And rowed him softer home Than oars divide the ocean, Too silver for a seam, Or butterflies, off banks of noon, Leap, plashless, as they swim.

        "text": "Of course Dad decided to blame me when he came downstairs this morning to make coffee and burn toast, and saw the mess in the kitchen and the living room. \"DANIEL,\" I heard him from my post in the bathroom. I stood there on my toes to see what I\u0027d look like if I were taller, brushing my teeth and wondering if I could get out the door with un-brushed hair, and without Miranda, my older and snottier sister, noticing. \"DANIEL!\" I came downstairs still wearing my pajamas and saw a bunch of magazines on the rug by the couch, toppled over from their usual stack on the coffee table. Then I saw the bad mess in the kitchen. The jars with Miranda\u0027s baking supplies are usually lined up along the counter, but one of them was on the floor in pieces, and there was flour everywhere. Dad was standing in the middle of it, wearing half of a suit: shiny black shoes and pressed work pants, but no shirt; and his hair still wet from the shower. I laughed. That was a mistake. \"Did you do this, funny man?\" The coffeemaker sounded like it was gargling mouthwash. I guess Dad wasn\u0027t so mad that he couldn\u0027t make his java.\"No, Dad, I didn\u0027t.\" It was the truth, too. When I turned off the TV the night before, the  magazines were still stacked. And when I got my nighttime cup of water from the kitchen, there was no flour on the floor. \"Really? Because we\u0027ve had this problem before, with footballs and jump ropes, and indoor kite-flying.\" Dad obviously did not believe me. \"Really, Dad, I have no idea how this happened. I got some water in the middle of the night, but everything was clean then.\" Dad turned around and got some bread and butter, and honey. The toaster sounded like it hurt when he pushed the lever down. It was old and never made toast right. I only ate toast when I slept over at other people\u0027s houses. Dad didn\u0027t really care what his toast tasted like, I guess. \"I don\u0027t have time to clean this up, Daniel, and I\u0027m mad. Go upstairs and get ready for school.\" Dad filled a big bowl with water. \"Okay.\" I was halfway up the stairs when Miranda\u0027s cat, Oatmeal, shot up underneath my legs. \"DAD!\" I yelled. \"I BET IT WAS OATMEAL!\"I don\u0027t think Dad heard me, but I got dressed and the more I thought about it, the more I just knew it had been Oatmeal. That cat always causes problems. At night he either fights things that can\u0027t fight back, like the couch or the cabinets or the laundry baskets downstairs, or he sits in the upstairs hallway and howls, trying to get into our rooms to show off the socks he hunts and kills. He\u0027s annoying, which means he\u0027s Miranda\u0027s perfect pet. \"Hey, Bozo.\" Miranda came out of her room dressed in high-tops and a red polka-dot dress. She had some bracelets on, which, plus the dress, made her look kind of like a girl, except that her bracelets had skulls on them and her sneakers were black. She was a weird sister. She was in sixth grade and I was in fourth. I didn\u0027t understand why she didn\u0027t dress normally. Everything had to have something black or bone-y in it. \"Your stupid cat got me in trouble, Miranda.\" \"Maybe if you hadn\u0027t set precedent so many times, you wouldn\u0027t get blamed for wrecking the house.\" \"I didn\u0027t set president!\" I didn\u0027t even know what that word meant. \"Precedent, dummy. And yes you did, every time you played ball or some other stupid game in the house.\" She walked past me and petted Oatmeal as he slithered toward her door. \"Hurry up, or I\u0027ll eat all the cereal.\" I didn\u0027t hurry up. I put on my shoes and was silently thankful that she hadn\u0027t noticed my messy hair. I walked back downstairs with heavy feet, and let my backpack hit the steps behind me. Dad was eating his burned toast with honey, and trying to mop up a gloppy mess on the floor. He did not look happy. Miranda was at the table eating a bowl of Kix. She threw one at me. I decided to skip cereal. \"Daniel, this is unacceptable,\" Dad muttered. \"Dad, it was Oatmeal. He went on a night rampage and did this.\"\"MIRANDA!\" Dad raised his voice.\"Dad, he\u0027s just being a cat. He has wild instincts.\" Miranda didn\u0027t even lift her head. \"You need to start keeping your cookie things in the pantry.\" \"They look good in the jars.\" \"Fine. They\u0027ll just have to look good in the jars in the pantry.\" Miranda decided not to argue, I guess, because she shut up. Dad was struggling. The paper towels he was using to wipe up the wet flour weren\u0027t doing a good job. He threw two handfuls in the trash, but there were still smears of paste on the ground and some dry flour powdering the corners of the kitchen. Dad looked at the clock on the stove, and he said, \"Look at the time! We have to go.\" Then he rushed to the laundry room to put on a work shirt. \"Get your school stuff together and get in the car,\" Dad said. He huffed his way out the door. Miranda got up and went back upstairs, leaving me in the kitchen by myself. I sidestepped the sticky streaks of flour on the ground and got a Popsicle from the freezer. Breakfast! When I got outside, Dad was already waiting in the driveway. I got in the front seat (take that, Miranda!) and noticed some crusty flour on the back of his work jacket. I didn\u0027t say anything. He\u0027d probably just get mad. He was already mad anyway and getting angrier, as he impatiently honked the horn for Miranda. She shuffled out the front door, holding her lumpy backpack in front of her with both arms. We pulled out and Dad turned on NPR.\"I hope you two packed lunch.\" \"I forgot,\" I said. \"Can I have some money?\" \"Here, take 10 bucks.\" Dad tossed his wallet into my lap. I looked back at Miranda. I was kind of disappointed that she hadn\u0027t gotten mad about me sitting in the front seat. \"Miranda, do you need money, too?\" Dad asked.\"No.\" \"What did you bring for lunch?\" \"Oatmeal.\" \"That\u0027s gross, weirdo.\" Who eats oatmeal for lunch, I thought. \"If you say so, kiddo.\" Dad rolled his eyes. \"I hope you packed the instant stuff, because if you cooked oatmeal just now, it\u0027s going to get really cold and nasty, and I\u0027m going to be really annoyed that you wasted time doing that while we were waiting outside for you.\" Miranda just looked out the window. We didn\u0027t talk for a few minutes, and the radio droned on about the news. \"Yeah, we waited forever,\" I said, turning around to glare. When I did, I noticed something weird. Miranda\u0027s backpack moved. I opened my mouth to say something but Miranda made a mean face and mouthed, \"Don\u0027t say anything.\" A little white paw poked out from under the flap on her bag. I turned around again. Unbelievable! How is it that I was the one who always got in trouble for what that cat did? Miranda was worse than I was! Dad pulled up to our school. \"Have a good day, guys,\" he said, and I still didn\u0027t tell him \", about the flour-paste on his coat. I got out; Miranda didn\u0027t. I stood on the sidewalk for a moment wondering why she was just sitting there. And then I saw Oatmeal squeeze his way out of her bag, despite her struggle to keep him contained. I slammed the door shut so he wouldn\u0027t escape. I heard her shriek and my dad yell, while I watched the cat tear the leather as he clawed his way under the passenger seat. \"MIRANDA!!!\" Dad\u0027s scream was muffled with all the doors closed. I could hear them arguing, and then Dad waved at me without looking and drove away. I probably should have felt a little angry that Miranda got to be late to school, or that my dad just drove away like that. But as I walked into the building, I just could not stop smiling. "

        "title": "About Homelessness",
        "author": "ReadWorks",
        "metadata": "Grade: 4 Lexile: 1120L",
        "text": "Homelessness is an issue that affects people of every age and from every country. If you walk down the street in many big cities in the United States, you might notice people sleeping on the sidewalk or begging for food or money. These individuals are very visible to passersby, and it is difficult to ignore them. But there are also homeless people who do not sleep on the streets. They are not as visible to the public eye, but they are also homeless. These people often spend their nights sleeping in shelters, which provide food, rooms, and often a variety of social services (like daycare). We might not see these people on the streets, but it does not mean that they aren\u0027t suffering. When thinking about homelessness, one of the first questions that might come to mind is: why are people homeless? People become homeless for a variety of reasons, often outside of their own personal control. Two key reasons have been identified on why people become homeless. The first is a lack of affordable housing. The second is poverty, or the condition of being poor. The government is usually responsible for providing affordable housing to people and families in need. It builds large apartment buildings or housing developments for people who cannot afford to live elsewhere. Sometimes there is not enough affordable housing for all the people who need it. Those who are unable to secure housing may become homeless. Homelessness and poverty are quite clearly linked. Poor people must often choose between such important things as buying food or paying for medical care versus paying the rent. When poor people are faced with these difficult decisions, housing is often the first expense to be dropped because it generally requires the largest amount of money. Many of the homeless in America are simply unable to find jobs due to a lack of opportunity. Others are mentally ill or addicted to drugs. Still others who are homeless have previously relied on public assistance but have lost that assistance for one reason or another. An example of a public assistance program is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides help for people who struggle to afford healthy and nutritious food. There are three distinct kinds of homelessness. The first is called chronic homelessness, and it represents the group of people who move from shelter to shelter in a seemingly never-ending cycle. Often, the chronically homeless are older, and often suffer from disabilities or addiction. The second type of homelessness is called transitional homelessness, and it describes people who must enter a shelter for a short period of time. For example, if they are evicted from their homes for not being able to pay the rent, they might go into a shelter or enter government-based transitional housing. They may live there for up to two years until they are able to get back on their feet. The third kind of homelessness is called episodic homelessness, which accounts for people who move in and out of shelters at various points throughout their life. Those who experience episodic homelessness usually have difficulty maintaining steady employment. People who are considered transitionally homeless and those who are episodically homeless are often young. Homelessness rises when people are unable to find or keep jobs. But it also affects people who are not even employed in the first place: children under sixteen years old. As minors, they are not legally allowed to work. According to the National Center on Family Homelessness, one in every 45 children experiences homelessness each year. Most families that experience homelessness are made up of a mother and her children. The National Center on Family Homelessness reports that 29 percent of adults in homeless families in the United States are working. Yet the wages are often not enough to support the various needs of a family, like healthcare, food, and shelter. Furthermore, many families try to stay out of shelters. Shelters can be noisy, overcrowded, and stressful places for both children and parents. These families would often rather stay at the homes of friends or relatives, or even sleep in their cars. Families that experience homelessness in any situation are under a ton of stress, due to the lack of stability and privacy. There are no simple solutions to this major social issue. But homelessness affects too many people around the world to be ignored. "

        "title": "Amusement Park Motion",
        "author": "Samantha Gross",
        "metadata": "Grade: 4 Lexile: 890L",
        "text": "Whiz! Bing! Thump! Ding ding ding ding ding! When they\u0027re jumbled up together, the sounds at an amusement park can become a roar. At the arcade, there is booming music and the sound of quarters clinking into slots. Two girls jump in unison as they compete in a dance game. Underneath it all, there is the rustling of prize tickets being folded up and jammed into pockets. At the amusement park, there is noise everywhere. And where there is noise, there is motion. On a hot summer day, some children hide out from the sun inside the cool, dark bumper car arena. One grinning boy is behind the wheel of a bright blue car with a thick, black bumper. He\u0027s too young to drive a real car, but here, he can speed around the track. The boy sets his sights on a long-haired girl in a green car. She\u0027s sitting still, caught in something of a bumper car traffic jam. Then he slams his car into hers. The collision stops his car in its tracks, but it sends her car sailing away from his. In the crash, his car\u0027s momentum shifts to her car. They both laugh. Elsewhere on the track, two other cars careen toward each other. When they crash, both bumper cars reverse course. They bounce backward, away from the point of impact. One driver\u0027s head is knocked sideways, but these mini crashes are all fun. No one is hurt and no one is crying. In the arcade nearby, something similar is happening at the pool table. One player slams her stick into the white cue ball. This sends the cue ball rolling quickly to the other end of the table, where it hits a striped ball. In an instant, the cue ball stops moving. The striped ball takes on its momentum and sails into the pocket. Her opponent isn\u0027t having much luck at the pool table. He strikes the cue ball with the stick, but aims badly. The white ball bounces off three edges of the pool table until it finally slows and comes to a stop. At the air hockey table, the action of the game is happening almost too quickly to follow. One player moves to protect her goal, but she\u0027s not holding onto her air hockey pusher tightly, and it goes flying out of her hand when the puck hits it. In the next room two boys are playing ping pong. One boy is new to the game and is losing. Every time he hits the ball, he swings the paddle with too much force. The tiny ball has very little mass, but the boy\u0027s fast swing sends it off the table entirely. In this case, the boy is giving the ball too much momentum. Momentum, the quantity of motion in a moving object, is determined by an object\u0027s mass and its velocity. Most of the time, it\u0027s against the rules to hit things. But at amusement parks, certain kinds of hitting are part of the fun. The boy losing at ping pong doesn\u0027t mind, because he\u0027s enjoying hitting the ball as hard as he can. At the batting cage, a girl wearing a helmet hits a baseball with so much force that it makes a loud \"crack!\" In the arcade, a man has paid two quarters to see how many small plastic animals he can whack with a rubber mallet. When he hits them, their heads sink back inside the machine. His daughter is sitting in front of another game. She\u0027s shooting small balls at stuffed monsters. If she hits one straight on, it falls over and she wins tickets. At another game, players pay a dollar for the chance to hit some milk bottles with a ball. If they knock all the bottles over, they win a huge stuffed animal. This game is very hard to win even if players throw the ball with a lot of force, because some of the bottles are very heavy. Often, the heavy bottle wobbles but doesn\u0027t fall over. One boy doesn\u0027t want to leave the amusement park, but he is exhausted. The batting cage, ping pong and the milk bottle game have left him with a very tired right arm. All the speed and crashes in the bumper car were fun, but they tired him out as well. There\u0027s only so much motion most people can enjoy in a day. Eventually, even the most energetic children run out of momentum. It\u0027s time for them to climb into bed and be still. "

        "text": "On the third Tuesday in March, Addie watched her sister transform from a little girl into a spider. This was not, Addie told me, a lie or an exaggeration. This was the absolute, cross- her-fingers, honest-to, goodness truth. \"I was sitting at breakfast,\" Addie began, \"and in comes the report card queen, wearing my pink sweater. I was so mad. I was just furious. And I glared at her, and I said, \u0027Take that off right now, you little bug!\u0027 And poof! She became a spider!\" \"Well, where is she now?\" I asked, because I\u0027ve seen many things before, but I\u0027ve never seen anyone turn into a spider. \"Well, she\u0027s human again, silly,\" Addie said, laughing. She looped her arm through mine, and we skipped down the sidewalk. (I happen to be one of the best skippers in the whole U.S.A., so that\u0027s the only way I travel.) Now, I\u0027m new in town, so I\u0027m in no position to turn down friends, but Addie M. Walker would not be my first choice. She\u0027s nice, don\u0027t get me wrong, but I think she might not always tell the truth. Take the story she told me not five minutes after I met her. \"I\u0027m part fairy,\" she said. \"Only fairies can wiggle their ears,\" and she pulled back her hair to show me. I tried to wiggle mine, but I only ended up hurting my jaw. As my father would say, though, \"beggars can\u0027t be choosers,\" and none of the other kids in this town is standing in line to be my friend. Today, we\u0027re going to the zoo. Our teacher, Mr. Laraby, is very excited. Too excited, it seems to me, because when he said the word \"ostrich,\" he spilled his entire cup of coffee down his shirt from giggling like a child who just had his first taste of ice cream. Addie chose me for her partner. Or rather, no one else chose me as a partner, and it was only the two of us left. When we got to the zoo, Addie walked right over to the elephants and said, \"I had a pet elephant when l was little. We called him Barb.\" Well, that was just too much for me. I\u0027d had enough. \"Addie M. Walker,\" I shouted, \"I\u0027m sick of your lies. Find a new partner!\" And I left,  skipping, of course, to see the giraffes. Just a few minutes later, I began to feel bad. (I can be very sensitive, you see.) It wasn\u0027t Addie\u0027s fault that no one had taught her to tell the truth. And she did seem to like me. In fact, she really was the only kid in my entire third grade class who was nice to me. I looked around. I was all alone in this part of the zoo. Mr. Laraby was probably near the ostriches, but I had no idea how to find them. I regretted saying anything to Addie. We could be skipping next to rhinos right now if I had just kept my mouth shut. And then, I saw her. And I swear this is the absolute, cross-my-fingers, honest-to-goodness truth. Addie was dancing ballet on top of a giraffe\u0027s back. I rubbed my eyes. Maybe the heat had gotten to me. But, no, there she was, performing pirouettes on top of the tallest giraffe. She giggled and waved. \"I told you I was a fairy!\" she yelled. I smiled. I was beginning to think life in this town wouldn\u0027t be so bad after all. "

        "text": "The sun rises, and the sun sets. It\u0027s nice to know we can rely on the sun to come up in the morning and go down at night. The sun is a wonderful thing. It is a star, and its light shines onto our planet. It is the ultimate source of energy. It heats our planet and makes life on Earth possible. Without the sun, trees and plants wouldn\u0027t get the light energy they need to grow. Without this light, we humans would have a hard time finding enough food to eat. We can always rely on the sun. The sun rises, and the sun sets. Summer days may be longer than winter days, but the sun always seems to do the same thing: it goes down at night and comes up for the day. But that\u0027s not always true. In some parts of the world, the sun can be up in the sky for the entire day. During the summer in Earth\u0027s Northern Hemisphere, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun so much that the sun in northern Alaska never goes below the horizon. In Barrow, Alaska, the sun doesn\u0027t even set for almost three months! This phenomenon is called midnight sun. Try sleeping through that! During the winter in Earth\u0027s Northern Hemisphere, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted in such a way that the sun doesn\u0027t come over the horizon in northern Alaska for over two months. Northern Alaska is located in the Arctic Circle, an area at the top of the earth. Although the sun never comes up during this part of the winter in the Arctic Circle, enough light shines so that you don\u0027t need a flashlight to walk around outside. This phenomenon is called polar night. It may be hard for people to get through these times of very little or prolonged sunlight. But plants and wildlife have adapted to these long days and long nights. Some animals hibernate for the winter, and others travel south to where there is more sunlight. Insects like mosquitos usually take a break during the night, but with a 24-hour sun, they can stay active and multiply. The birds that eat these insects now have plenty of food all day long for themselves and their baby chicks. Some plants in the Arctic Circle grow nonstop during the long days. Animals like caribou benefit from this growing season and easily find plants to eat. But you don\u0027t want too much of a good thing. If you spend too much time in the sun, you can get a painful sunburn, even in the winter. Plants not used to a lot of sunlight can receive too much sunlight and stop growing. Most animals, including us, are used to a regular sunrise and sunset. The placement of the sun definitely helps remind us when to brush our teeth, take a bath, and go to sleep! "

        "text": "During the 1800s and 1900s, immigrants from all over the world began moving to New York City in large numbers. They were coming to seek a better life for their families. Often, immigrants of a certain ethnicity lived in the same neighborhood. In New York, many Italians lived in neighborhoods like Little Italy, in Manhattan. Many of the families lived in cramped apartment buildings, called \"tenements.\" Because the tenements were so small, people spent a lot of time outside. Some ethnic groups formed organizations called social clubs. These social clubs were housed in small Clubhouses where people, particularly men, could hang out and talk. The social clubs became the centers of many neighborhoods. They were places where men could gather after work and where families could gather on special occasions. During holidays, many of the social clubs threw parties. If a family in the neighborhood needed help, the social club might get together to help them. Membership in these clubs was a privilege. A member was required to pay dues to the club. When a neighborhood boy was allowed to join his local social club, it was like a rite of passage for him. It meant that he was one step closer to becoming a man. Perhaps the group of people with more social clubs than anyone was the Italians. Italians had social clubs not just in Little Italy, but in many other neighborhoods, like Bensonhurst and Carroll Gardens, in Brooklyn. The Italians saw these clubs as an important way of maintaining their native heritage. Sometimes, members of some of the clubs would be from the same region of Italy. While the members of the clubs were all Americans, they still celebrated certain Italian holidays. Many of the clubs would play Italian music and cook Italian food. Local politicians would often drop by the clubs at election time, to try and get votes. However, as New York has changed, many of these Italian clubs have disappeared. Italians have moved out of Manhattan and Brooklyn to other areas, such as the borough of Staten Island and the state of New Jersey. As other groups have moved into these ethnic neighborhoods, the membership of many of the clubs has declined. As members have gotten older or died, fewer younger Italians have taken their place. This has led to many of the social clubs closing. While New York used to have dozens of Italian social clubs, only a handful are now left. Today, however, some of these social clubs are still going strong. For example, the Van Westerhout Cittadini Molesi, in Brooklyn\u0027s Carroll Gardens neighborhood, still has several hundred members. The club was founded by men who had emigrated from a small town in Italy, Mola di Bari. Now, most of the members are from other places, but they are still of Italian descent. While many of them still live in Carroll Gardens, some live in other neighborhoods but still drop by the club to see their old friends and neighbors. The clubs that remain continue to be important parts of the neighborhoods. Every July 4th, one of the clubs in Carroll Gardens holds a party to which everyone in the neighborhood, Italians and non-Italians alike, is invited. The social club fills a pool in the parking lot and serves pasta and cannoli, an Italian dessert. This is a nice way for people in the neighborhood to get to know each other more over Italian food. The neighborhoods around the remaining Italian social clubs are more diverse now. You can find people not just from Italy, but also from dozens of countries, each with different ideas and rituals. These clubs have evolved to help unite people from many different cultures, but they continue to preserve a specific ethnic tradition. "

        "text": "\"That!\" said Francis. \"I want to ride on that!\" \"Put your hand down,\" said Mom. \"It\u0027s rude to point.\" Francis didn\u0027t care what was rude. This was the coolest thing he\u0027d seen on his entire vacation, and he wanted to make sure everyone knew about it. Francis and his family were in New Orleans, and even though the city was supposed to be fun, Francis couldn\u0027t tell why. They had spent the entire day walking back and forth on streets that all looked the same. At each corner there would be another old house. On the second floor would be a crummy-looking wrought iron balcony. The houses were all different colors, which should have been fun, but the colors were boring pastels. They were girl colors, which explained why Francis\u0027 sister, Angela, was so excited by them. \"Oh wow, Dad,\" she would say. \"Look at the detailing on that ironwork.\"\"Why don\u0027t they make the iron into fun shapes?\" asked Francis. \"Like swords or rocket ships or pirates.\" \"You don\u0027t understand anything about detailing.\" Detailing was Angela\u0027s new favorite word. She used it about 15 times an hour. She had also taken to correcting the way Francis said things. If he saw Burgundy Street and said the Chartres Street, saying it like \"charts,\" she would testily insist that it was pronounced \"charter,\" even though it wasn\u0027t even spelled like that. New Orleans was confusing. But finally he had seen something that made perfect sense. Something that wasn\u0027t confusing or boring or pastel: a streetcar, trundling down the middle of the road, with a hook connecting it to the cable above. \"Can we ride on it?\" he asked. \"Pleeeeeeease?\" \"Ugh,\" said Angela. Ugh was her other favorite word. \"Streetcars are for tourists.\"\"But we are tourists! And buildings are for losers.\" And with that, Francis did the only thing he could to save the afternoon. He ran, pounding his feet on the sidewalk, huffing and puffing in a mad dash to get to the streetcar before it moved on and took all the fun in the world with it. \"Angela! Go after your brother!\" Mom and Dad weren\u0027t much for running, so they let Angela do it for them. She charged after Francis, her long legs making up the ground easily. But he had too good a head start. He leapt onto the back of the small red streetcar, landing perfectly. Angela stumbled as she jumped and landed flat on her face. \"Two bucks asked the conductor. \"It\u0027s on me,\" said Francis, as he extracted two wrinkled dollar bills from his pocket. \"All right, let\u0027s go,\" said Angela, as she dragged herself to her feet. \"We are going! Look And Angela saw that it was too late. They were already on their way. Panicked, she asked the conductor where the streetcar was headed. \"You get on the car, you don\u0027t know where it\u0027s going?\" asked the conductor, whose New Orleans accent was as thick as cane syrup. \"Just tell me!\" \"We go to the aquarium.\" As Angela frantically texted her parents to meet them at the aquarium, Francis watched the city slide by beside them. At that speed, the buildings didn\u0027t look so boring. They seemed to blend together, swirling into an unbroken streak of pastels. Even the silly balconies started to look like a fun place to put your feet up and have a soda. And on his left was the river, wide and flat and brown and magnificent. \"I can see why they call it Big Muddy,\" he said, as his sister plopped down onto the seat beside him, inspecting her skinned knee. \"What?\" \"I said, I see why people call the river Big Muddy. I guess it is pretty cool how old this town is.\" \"Yeah,\" she said. \"And look at the ironwork on the side of the streetcar!\" \"The detailing is wonnnnnnnnderful,\" he said, and she socked him playfully on the shoulder. \"I guess a streetcar ride wasn\u0027t such a bad idea after al \"And just wait until we get to the aquarium "

        "text": "On August 10, 2006 a 140-foot-long water main at the intersection of West Broadway and Duane Street in New York City, finally had its fill, bursting open for the first time since it was built at 1870. The break caused flooding in 15 residential and office buildings, and some of them were immediately evacuated, meaning that everyone had to leave. Part of bigger water supply systems, water mains are underground pipes that help bring water into peoples\u0027 homes, offices, restaurants, and anywhere there is a sink. . Temperature change causes most water main breaks, even a ten-degree change can make water mains more susceptible to breaking. When temperatures fall below freezing or when the temperature becomes very hot, the ground around water mains shifts. This puts stress on water mains, and it might lead to water mains breaking. When a water main breaks, it can shut off the water supply people use in their houses and businesses. Many people were stuck standing on the sidewalk in the very early hours of the morning, while others who lived in the neighborhood didn\u0027t even know about the incident until they saw it on the news. \"I just had to walk an extra block out of the way today. They got it fixed really quickly,\" said Annouchka Engel, who lives on Murray Street and West Broadway. \"This morning there was water everywhere and now it\u0027s almost all cleared up.\" Local businesses, however, were instantly faced with devastating, unavoidable damages. \"The majority of our stock is damaged, as well as a lot of our electronic equipment, but the city is going to compensate us,\" said Dajuah Morgan, Assistant Manager of the American Apparel store at 140 West Broadway. Once the basement had filled with water, as much as $50,000 worth of merchandise was badly damaged, but she predicted the store would reopen again early that evening. The telecommunication building at 60 Hudson Street, a longtime concern among residents because of its diesel fuel storage, experienced several feet of flooding in the basement. \"It happens in every city,\" said Michael Saucier, spokesperson for the Department of Environmental Protection, noting that the department spends $20-30 million each year replacing old water mains before they break. As he watched dozens of Con-Ed workers milling about West Broadway, Saucier astutely resolved, \"You can\u0027t get to them all, though.\" "

        "text": "We know that living things, humans, plants, and animals, die one day. Suppose you have a vase with roses and sunflowers. The flowers will wilt and wither away in a few days. Then how do we find flowers to put in our vase the next day? How are there enough roses at the florist every day if all these roses die? The answer is pretty simple. Plants, animals, and human beings all reproduce. So, even when a particular flower or bird dies, the species as a whole continues to live because there are many others of the same kind. Reproduction is essential to the survival of all species. Without it, they would perish. Imagine if everyone in the world decided not to have children, there would come a time when no human beings are left on earth! Where Are Babies From? Reproduction, \"re + production\", is the process by which living things are created. Two kinds of reproduction are sexual and asexual. Asexual reproduction is the process in which one organism produces a copy of itself without the help of another organism. For example: a bacteria can split into two cells on its own, tulips can reproduce through bulbs, and strawberries through stems. Sexual reproduction involves two individuals of the opposite sex (male and female) who come together to produce an offspring. Just as human beings have two parents, most animals and many plants do too. Asexual Reproduction When an organism reproduces on its own, it creates a copy of itself. Let\u0027s see how this happens in onions and potatoes. If you leave the potato out for a few days, it begins to develop new stems or sprouts from its eyes. Each of these sprouts can become a new potato plant. And each of these new plants will be identical to the parent. What about onions? An onion is a bulb or an underground stem. Smaller \"bulblets\" form at the bottom of the bulb and can give rise to new plants. Sexual Reproduction Do you ever find your parents arguing over who you resemble more? Your mother might say that you have her eyes. Your father might say you are tall like him. Sexual reproduction produces offspring that have some of the characteristics of both parents but are not identical to either of them. Sexual reproduction happens in plants, animals, insects, and fish. Mammals, such as human beings, dogs, cats, and hippos can give birth to live young offspring. Other animals like pigeons and lizards lay eggs. "

        "text": "Michelle Gadot had never been to Thailand before. She didn\u0027t speak the language, and she didn\u0027t have family members who lived there; in fact, she didn\u0027t know anyone who lived there at all. But in 2007, Michelle found herself teaching English to children in one of the busiest cities in the world: Bangkok. Michelle was twenty-two years old when she went to Thailand. (In fact, she had her twenty-third birthday the day after she arrived in the country.) After she graduated from Ithaca College in 2006, she worked as a server for a year. \"I didn\u0027t know what I wanted to do for a career,\" she said. \"But I\u0027ve always wanted to travel and live abroad. When I heard about the programs available for young people to move overseas and teach in different countries, I thought, \u0027That\u0027s perfect for me!\u0027\" She moved back into her parents\u0027 home in New Jersey to save money for her trip. She worked at a cafe and saved as much as she could, knowing that she wanted to travel as often as possible while she was in Asia. When finally she found a placement teaching English to high school students in Bangkok, she booked a plane ticket to Thailand for October of that year. Bangkok is the capital of Thailand, a small country in Southeast Asia known for its food, beaches, and culture. The city sits on the Chao Phraya River, and is home to more than eight million people. It is one of the most modern cities in the region. Thailand is a popular destination for people who want to teach English. Other countries in Asia, such as China, Japan, and South Korea are similarly popular. Young people from English-speaking countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, flock to these areas to live and teach abroad. Usually, hiring packages for new teachers include airfare to and from their home country, training, housing, and salary. Teachers are expected to work full-time. Michelle signed a contract to teach for four months in Thailand. She was very excited to meet new people and experience a different culture. She had traveled a little bit with her family before moving to Thailand, but she had never lived outside the United States for a substantial amount of time. The first thing that surprised Michelle about Bangkok was the rain. It was monsoon season when she arrived, so for hours, the sky poured water onto anyone unlucky enough to be caught without an umbrella. She liked that the streets seemed to come alive every morning. \"There were people setting up makeshift restaurants on the corners. And the food,\" she gushed, \"was amazing. I still dream about the papaya salad.\" At work, Michelle noticed that Thai schools were very different from American schools. \"I was surprised by some things,\" she explained. \"Some things were very different than when I was in school.\" She went on to explain that in Thailand, the students were greeted every morning by their principal. They also practiced Buddhism in school and prayed every day. Students went to school from 8 am. to 3 pm. and they were very excited to learn English. Michelle played games with them, and read them stories to help them practice the language. But it wasn\u0027t all work for Michelle. \"I really tried to travel as often as I could. I took weekend trips to nearby beaches, and visited temples and museums as much as possible. And I went to Laos and Cambodia, too.\" Michelle found it easy to travel in Thailand. \"It\u0027s a great place to travel if you\u0027re a tourist. Everything is set up to make things easier for you, buses, boats, planes.\" Although Michelle loved her time in Thailand, she began to miss her family. \"It was hard being so far from home. And the time difference is about twelve hours. It was difficult to catch my friends and family on the phone at times that were convenient for both of us.\" After completing her contract, she taught in Thailand for two more months at a summer camp, and then found a short-term teaching job in South Korea. Then, it was time to go home. \"It was a life-changing experience. I\u0027d recommend it to anyone.\" "

The ball is shooting through the air, going nearly 100 miles per hour towards home base, and the batter is crouched over, arm muscles flexed, ready to swing. The batter hits the ball with all his might, and it starts going the other way ,  way, way, far away. The ball takes off and starts flying up high in the sky, making its way out of the park. It is up there in the air with the birds and the clouds, shiny bright white in the light of the sun. The batter knows that he hit a homer. He watches the ball for a second, and admires how it looks up there, arching through the sky. The pitcher knows he got beat and hangs his head. The batter smiles and drops his bat. He begins to run to first base. The pitcher is upset with himself, and kicks the pitching mound with his foot. A little puff of dust pops up and blows in the wind. The batter circles to second base. By this point the ball has gone out of the park. The crowd is cheering. The batter rounds third base and jogs home. All his teammates are waiting for him there. They give him hi-fives and pats on the back. He knows he really did it. He hit that ball. It was going one way, and he made it go the other ,  all the way out of the park. "

        "text": "Harry Smith is a police officer in the town where he grew up. His town is called Bergen. Harry always loved living in Bergen since he was a boy. He never, ever thought of leaving. When it came time for young Harry to figure out what job he wanted as a grownup, there was never a doubt in his mind. Harry knew he wanted to be a police officer. He thought it would be a good fit for him. Harry had a desire to help other folks in his community, and he felt that there was no better way to fulfill his desire than to become a police officer. When Officer Harry is working or on-duty, he spends a lot of his day \"on the beat.\" That means Officer Harry basically walks around a certain neighborhood. Part of his job is certainly watching out for people trying to cause trouble. However, Officer Harry also says that he thinks he has a much bigger, more importantjob too. \"When I am out in the neighborhood, I have to get to know people,\" he says. \"The people of Bergen should trust me, and I have to show them that they can by introducing myself, being kind and very professional.\" Officer Harry believes that he needs everyone\u0027s support to do his job well. He says, \"We\u0027re all really working together to make sure the area is safe.\" Officer Harry has to catch a bad guy every now and again, though. When he feels there is \"probable cause\" for him to make an arrest in a certain situation, he will take action. Probable cause means that, as a police officer, he feels there is a good reason to believe a person has committed a crime. In other words, Officer Harry cannot simply arrest anyone he wants. He will eventually have to explain to someone why he did so. \"There was one time where I happened to be walking down the street and a man suddenly ran out of a candy store,\" Officer Harry remembers. \"He had a bag in his hand and the owner of the store, Ray, an old friend of mine, was yelling for help. That definitely gave me probable cause.\" Officer Harry was able to run the robber down and take him to jail. There are other occasions where Officer Harry searches for someone he has been asked to arrest. \"There are these documents called \u0027arrest warrants,\u0027 which tell police officers who we are supposed to bring to jail, where we might find them, and why they need to be arrested,\" he explains. When these warrants are created, someone else has already figured out that there is probable cause for someone to be arrested. \"They make things easier for me,\" Officer Harry says, smiling. \"I\u0027d rather ask a suspect calmly to join me in my police car than have to run after him or her on the street!\" Though he definitely would prefer to never have to arrest anybody, it\u0027s part of Officer Harry\u0027s job, a job he truly loves. \"I like the people of this neighborhood,\" he explains. \"And they seem to like me, too. They understand that I don\u0027t want to be mean to people. All I want to do is help keep them safe.\" "

        "text": "\"Tuesday. 12:45. Recess. The game is tag. The stakes are high. There is no time to waste,\" Ryan said this to himself under his breath, on the edge of the jungle gym where kids played tag. A football fan, Ryan\u0027s favorite part of the game was the commentators. Their deep, serious voices made football seem like more than a game. They made it dramatic, like a gladiator fight from ancient Rome. Ryan thought gladiators were pretty cool. When kids on his playground played tag, he pretended to be a commentator. In his deepest possible voice, he took the imagined audience through the ups and downs of the match. \"Around the corner comes Billy Watkins,\" he intoned. \"Billy\u0027s having a strong season so far, and those who watch this sport closely think he might be about to step up to a higher level. If he fulfills his promise, his name could stand alongside the greats of the game, names like Shirley Tompkins and Judy Whitmore, Andy Tobin and George Francis.\" As he came around the corner, though, Billy Watkins slipped in the mulch and fell on his face. He rolled back and forth on the ground, whimpering. No one showed sympathy. \"On the other hand,\" Ryan said, \"Billy may disappoint us all.\" Ryan knew something about disappointment. He had time to play commentator because nobody really wanted him to play tag. He\u0027d never understood why, but when he joined the game, nobody would chase him. If he did somehow manage to become \"It,\" nobody would run. But he didn\u0027t try to play; if he just narrated the game, he wouldn\u0027t be left out. He was still playing tag, he was just playing it in a different way. \"Hey kid!\" said a voice behind him, a freckle-faced girl with frizzy pigtails named Angela. A newcomer to the game, Ryan thought to himself. A rookie hungry for respect. A,  \"Why aren\u0027t you playing the game?\" she barked, interrupting his reverie. \"I\u0027m playing.\" \"No you\u0027re not! You\u0027re just standing over here being weird.\" \"I\u0027m providing commentary, for, uh...\" Ryan tried to think of anything to say besides \"for the folks at home.\" He couldn\u0027t. \"For the folks at home.\" \"What folks?! Are you on the phone or something?\" \"Just leave me alone.\" \"I can\u0027t!\" \"Why not?\" \"Because I\u0027m \u0027It!\u0027 Why aren\u0027t you running? I\u0027m \u0027It\u0027, and that means you\u0027re supposed to run.\" Ryan shrugged. She poked him in the stomach. \"Fine! Now you\u0027re \u0027It!\u0027\" Ryan froze. He hadn\u0027t been \u0027It\u0027 for a long time. He didn\u0027t know what to do. The rest of the players stopped, too, and stared at him. If he moved, would they move too? Or would they stand there, waiting for him to quit embarrassing himself and get offthe playground? \"Uh, weirdo!\" shouted Angela. \"This isn\u0027t freeze tag. Start running!\" So he ran the only way he knew how: with narration. \"Heart pounding in his ears, the frightened young commentator springs into action,\" he muttered. \"He isn\u0027t sure how, he isn\u0027t sure why, but he knows one thing. He is going to get that girl with the pigtails.\" \"Quit talking to yourself, and run like you mean it!\" said Angela. \"He races up the slide, and across the footbridge, his target in his sights just a few feet away. The bridge\u0027s wooden slats clatter under his feet, sending shockwaves up his spine and into his jaw. Ryan is undaunted. This will be his hour. He reaches toward his foe, stretches out his fingers, and, ow\\uff01Ryan\u0027s hands clutched air. He fell face-forward, off the jungle gym, landing where Angela had been just a moment before. She had slid down the fireman\u0027s pole. He had not been so graceful \"Dazed and confused, the young competitor tries to get his bearings. He looks up and sees the face of his opponent staring down at him, looking concerned and curious about why Ryan is still talking to himself.\" \"I think you might have broken your brain,\" Angela said. \"Ryan\u0027s brain is fine. Angela is the one who needs to worry.\" \"Why?\" Ryan leapt to his feet and poked Angela in the stomach. \"Because Angela is \u0027It!\u0027\" Ryan turned and ran, a happy gladiator, battling at last.

        "title": "Shasta Dam",
        "author": "James Folta",
        "text": "Shasta Dam is one of the largest dams in the United States. The dam is 602 feet tall and 883 feet thick at its base. Located in Northern California, it blocks the flow of California\u0027s biggest river, the Sacramento River. This dam forms a big lake behind it, Lake Shasta, which has a 365, mile-long shore line. The dam\u0027s main use is to provide water for farms in California\u0027s Central Valley. The Central Valley is 400 miles long, and grows over 250 different types of fruits and vegetables. The dam protects farms from floods, and it helps to prevent a buildup of salt water from San Francisco Bay. It also provides water for people in nearby towns to drink and use. It has a hydroelectric power plant that creates electricity. Shasta Dam isn\u0027t the only dam in the area. It is just one part of the Central Valley Project, a huge system of dams and reservoirs that provides water to the farms in the Central Valley. This water system was initially conceived of in the 1870s, after people moved to the area in the 1850s. People flocked to California because of the gold rush, hoping to get rich by mining for gold. While most people didn\u0027t strike it rich, many ended up staying in the area and farming. But the valley has contrasting rain patterns. In the north, there is more than 30 inches of rain per year, while the south gets less than 5 inches. There are also droughts, when almost no rain falls at all. Additionally, the Central Valley is at a risk to be flooded due to spring rain and infiltrated by saline water coming from the bay. Since farms need water to grow plants, the farmers needed a better, more reliable way to get water. This is why the Central Valley dams were built. Shasta Dam took many years to build, starting in 1937 and ending in 1945. Many thousands of workers helped build it. In fact, there was so much work to be done that building contractors had to join together in groups to finish it. The first step was to have 4,700 men dig out millions of tons of granite to make room for the dam. An almost 10-mile conveyor belt ran 24 hours a day to move the rocks away. Next, a railroad brought in dry cement. It was mixed with Sacramento River water, rock, and sand to make wet cement. Before it dried, the workers had to quickly rush the cement to the dam using a custom- built cable system. Once there, the cement was poured into interlocking wooden structures to form the large blocks that make up the dam. After two days, the cement was dry and the wooden structures were broken down and taken away, leaving the dried cement blocks. Overall, the dam has been a positive addition to the Central Valley, allowing people and farms to thrive. But there are also drawbacks to the dam. The biggest loss is what is now buried under Lake Shasta. When the dam was built, Native American villages and sacred places belonging to the Winnemem Wintu tribe were flooded, and the people who lived there were forced to move. Local salmon were also affected. Because of changes in the Sacramento River from the dam, the salmon have had a harder time living, traveling, and breeding in the river. Fortunately, the dam has a water temperature control system to help the salmon survive. Shasta Dam is an extremely impressive structure, and is the result of hard work by many people. The dam allows many more people to live and work in the area today. The Central Valley of California would not be the same without it. "

The game is tag. The stakes are high. There is no time to waste,\" Ryan said this to himself under his breath, on the edge of the jungle gym where kids played tag. A football fan, Ryan\u0027s favorite part of the game was the commentators. Their deep, serious voices made football seem like more than a game. They made it dramatic, like a gladiator fight from ancient Rome. Ryan thought gladiators were pretty cool. When kids on his playground played tag, he pretended to be a commentator. In his deepest possible voice, he took the imagined audience through the ups and downs of the match. \"Around the corner comes Billy Watkins,\" he intoned. \"Billy\u0027s having a strong season so far, and those who watch this sport closely think he might be about to step up to a higher level. If he fulfills his promise, his name could stand alongside the greats of the game, names like Shirley Tompkins and Judy Whitmore, Andy Tobin and George Francis.\" As he came around the corner, though, Billy Watkins slipped in the mulch and fell on his face. He rolled back and forth on the ground, whimpering. No one showed sympathy. \"On the other hand,\" Ryan said, \"Billy may disappoint us all.\" Ryan knew something about disappointment. He had time to play commentator because nobody really wanted him to play tag. He\u0027d never understood why, but when he joined the game, nobody would chase him. If he did somehow manage to become \"It,\" nobody would run. But he didn\u0027t try to play; if he just narrated the game, he wouldn\u0027t be left out. He was still playing tag, he was just playing it in a different way. \"Hey kid!\" said a voice behind him, a freckle-faced girl with frizzy pigtails named Angela. A newcomer to the game, Ryan thought to himself. A rookie hungry for respect. A,  \"Why aren\u0027t you playing the game?\" she barked, interrupting his reverie. \"I\u0027m playing.\" \"No you\u0027re not! You\u0027re just standing over here being weird.\" \"I\u0027m providing commentary, for, uh...\" Ryan tried to think of anything to say besides \"for the folks at home.\" He couldn\u0027t. \"For the folks at home.\" \"What folks?! Are you on the phone or something?\" \"Just leave me alone.\" \"I can\u0027t!\" \"Why not?\" \"Because I\u0027m \u0027It!\u0027 Why aren\u0027t you running? I\u0027m \u0027It\u0027, and that means you\u0027re supposed to run.\" Ryan shrugged. She poked him in the stomach. \"Fine! Now you\u0027re \u0027It!\u0027\" Ryan froze. He hadn\u0027t been \u0027It\u0027 for a long time. He didn\u0027t know what to do. The rest of the players stopped, too, and stared at him. If he moved, would they move too? Or would they stand there, waiting for him to quit embarrassing himself and get off the playground? \"Uh, weirdo!\" shouted Angela. \"This isn\u0027t freeze tag. Start running!\" So he ran the only way he knew how: with narration. \"Heart pounding in his ears, the frightened young commentator springs into action,\" he muttered. \"He isn\u0027t sure how, he isn\u0027t sure why, but he knows one thing. He is going to get that girl with the pigtails.\" \"Quit talking to yourself, and run like you mean it!\" said Angela. \"He races up the slide, and across the footbridge, his target in his sights just a few feet away. The bridge\u0027s wooden slats clatter under his feet, sending shockwaves up his spine and into his jaw. Ryan is undaunted. This will be his hour. He reaches toward his foe, stretches out his fingers, and, ow Ryan\u0027s hands clutched air. He fell face-forward, off the jungle gym, landing where Angela had been just a moment before. She had slid down the fireman\u0027s pole. He had not been so graceful \"Dazed and confused, the young competitor tries to get his bearings. He looks up and sees the face of his opponent staring down at him, looking concerned and curious about why Ryan is still talking to himself.\" \"I think you might have broken your brain,\" Angela said. \"Ryan\u0027s brain is fine. Angela is the one who needs to worry.\" \"Why?\" Ryan leapt to his feet and poked Angela in the stomach. \"Because Angela is \u0027It!\u0027\" Ryan turned and ran, a happy gladiator, battling at last.

        "text": "Look up at the sky on a clear day. You will see the sun. It is bright and shiny, warming much of what its light touches. Look up at the sky again at night. You may see the stars. They are also bright and shiny, glimmering in the dark sky. You may also see the moon. It looks bright and shiny, reflecting light from the sun. People have always looked up at the sky with wonder. Some have even studied the sun, moon, and stars. These people, called astronomers, have learned that those objects in the sky do not stay in the same place all the time. The earth revolves around the sun and also rotates on its axis, which is an imaginary line that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole, through the earth\u0027s center. It takes just under 24 hours for the earth to complete one rotation on its axis ,  a day, that\u0027s right! And guess how long it takes the earth to revolve around the sun? A little over 365 days. That\u0027s a year, with an extra quarter of a day. Let\u0027s take a closer look at the moon. The earth does not revolve around the moon. Instead, the moon revolves around the earth. It takes the moon about four weeks to complete a revolution around the earth. The portion of the moon we, here on Earth, see changes over this period of about four weeks as the moon\u0027s position around the earth changes. The moonlight we see at night is the moon\u0027s reflection of sunlight onto Earth. The different ways the moon appears to us are known as the moon\u0027s phases. The moon\u0027s phases depend on the moon\u0027s position in relation to the earth and the sun. The four-week period starts and ends with the new moon. The new moon cannot be seen because the side of the moon lit by the sun is facing away from the earth. This is because the moon is nearly between the sun and the earth at this time. After that comes the first quarter moon, which is when we see half of the side of the moon lit by the sun. Then comes the full moon, when we can see the entire side of the moon lit up by the sun. This is because the earth is nearly lined up between the sun and the moon, and the sunlit part of the moon is facing the earth. One of the last phases is called the last quarter moon. This is when we see the other half of the lit side of the moon. Sometimes the way the sun, moon, and earth are positioned causes an event known as an eclipse. There are two types of eclipses. A lunar eclipse happens when the earth passes between the moon and the sun and when the earth blocks the moon from the sun. The earth\u0027s shadow may block the entire moon or just part of the moon from view. A solar eclipse happens when the moon passes directly between the earth and the sun. A solar eclipse can block part of the sun or the entire sun from the earth\u0027s view. Because of the regular orbit of the moon around the earth and the regular orbit of the earth around the sun, astronomers can predict when an eclipse would happen even many years into the future. "

        "text": "Imagine you are building a new house but you are not using any new material. A house like this would use construction material like wood, glass and metal from other places. By using old material, you are reusing and recycling material that already exists. This house would be really different from houses built with new construction material but it would be just as comfortable. If you build your house like this, you are building a house that is friendly to the environment, or eco- friendly. To reuse material is to find a new place and use for material no one uses anymore. These other places could be old houses being torn down, construction sites and recycling centers like junkyards and scrap yards. It can be as simple as buying a used bathtub and putting it in the new house. Or it can be more complicated, like using the metal from old umbrellas to make lighting fixtures. Using your imagination you can recycle a lot of different things for different uses. Houses are torn down every day. Find a house before it\u0027s torn down and get whatever wood you can for the frame of your new house. You could reuse doors and floors from this old house. Even if the house is already torn down, maybe there are many pieces of broken mirrors. You could glue them together to make a different, yet pretty mirror. If you live near a beach, you can find driftwood and use it for decoration or the railing of your porch. If you live near farms, you can reuse an old grain silo. A tall grain silo gives you a second floor! If you live near a shipping port, you may find old shipping containers that can make a great existing structure. They already come with four walls and a ceiling. You can then find wooden shipping crates to lay a new floor inside your shipping container. You can stack old tires from a junkyard to make a wall. Another wall could be made out of used glass bottles. A wall made of glass bottles lets light pass through and can be very pretty. Other walls can be made out of scrap metal found in scrap yards. They would be shiny and look very different from your tire and glass wall. Can you imagine your eco-friendly house yet? Make sure you think about what kind of house you want and plan it well. Find the right type and amount of construction material. Also, make sure your construction material is clean and safe for reuse. If you don\u0027t plan your house well, you may feel like your house looks more like trash than like your new home! "

        "text": "My brother-in-law, Matt, is a painter. When you look at his paintings, you feel just like Matt must have felt when he painted them. I asked Matt how he paints such beautiful paintings. \"Well, Jesse,\" he said. \"I put myself into every painting.\" \"What do you mean?\" I asked. \"It all began many years ago...\" said Matt, and he told me a story. When Matt was learning how to paint, his teacher gave him an assignment. She told him to paint a picture of his studio. What a boring assignment, thought Matt. Matt liked best to paint things that he found very strange and unusual. He painted cities all lit up like the starry sky at night, giant scientific machines, and cactuses he had seen while hiking in the desert. Why would he want to paint his studio where he worked every day? Matt planned on spending the next day painting. He would try to finish the assignment quickly. \"The sooner I finish,\" he thought, \"the sooner I can paint something more exciting.\" He set up his easel and started to paint his studio. He painted the floors, the walls, the lamp, the window, and all the unfinished paintings that were hung up on the walls. \"I\u0027m almost done,\" he thought, \"and it\u0027s not even noon yet.\" But it didn\u0027t look quite right. Matt kept painting. The longer be painted, the more he noticed things in his studio he hadn\u0027t painted yet. He painted a piece of tape on the wall, a branch outside his window, and a dab of green paint he had spilled on the floor. He even painted a fly that was buzzing around the room and a fleck of dust that was coasting through a sunbeam. It was five in the afternoon when he finally paused and wiped his brow. He could tell something was still missing, but he didn\u0027t see a single thing he hadn\u0027t painted. I must be losing my mind, he thought. But I know there is something I\u0027m forgetting. Suddenly, Matt realized what he had forgotten. He had forgotten to paint the easel his painting was resting on, the palette with all the different colors of paint he was using, and his paintbrushes. Most importantly, Matt had forgotten to paint himself. Matt painted himself, just as he was in real life, standing before the easel, painting. It was long past midnight, when something magical happened. The painter Matt had just painted started to move. I am losing my mind! The painter in Matt\u0027s painting dipped his paintbrush into the paints on the painted palette. Matt watched him spread the paints over the small canvas that was in the painting. In a moment, the painter had painted the same painting Matt had painted in real life. Then, the painter in Matt\u0027s painting painted an even smaller easel and an even smaller painter in front of it. Imagine Matt\u0027s surprise when the smaller painter that Matt\u0027s painter had painted began to paint an even smaller easel in the painting that was in the painting that Matt had painted! And in this tiny painting, there was an even smaller painter who painted an even smaller painting. In that painting the painter had already started painting an even smaller painting, and in that painting was yet another painter... \"When I woke up the next morning,\" Matt told me, \"the painting was finished. It was the most beautiful painting I\u0027d ever made. And I had learned a lesson: so long as I put myself into my paintings, my paintings will paint themselves.\" "

        "text": "Imagine watching hundreds of thousands of bats swirl around you, swarming to form a large, black mass that flies off into the horizon. At Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico, this scene is a regular occurrence. The caverns, located in a United States National Park, are home to around 400,000 Mexican free-tailed bats that fly out into the night sky each evening at dusk to feed on nearby moths and insects, returning at dawn to their caves. The spectacle draws crowds from around the world into the Chihuahuan Desert, where the park is located. One such visitor was Laurel Mathews, who once visited the caves with her family on a road trip. \"At the entrance to one of the caves, there\u0027s stadium seating for visitors to watch the bats,\" she remembers. \"We waited a long time to see them. Finally, they started circling out of the cave and they flew off, out came more and more and more, all of them flying in loops and then out into the sky. It was amazing that there were so many!\" Laurel also remembers the sound the bats made, describing the high, screeching noise. \"It was really creepy, but also really cool,\" she says. Upon their arrival to the Carlsbad Caverns National Park, the Mathews family was greeted by a lone visitors\u0027 center. \"It didn\u0027t look very spectacular when we first drove in,\" she admits. \"But then we started exploring the big network of underground caves.\" The formation of the caves is a result of a fossilized reef that existed 250 to 280 million years ago in an inland sea that has long since disappeared. Since limestone is typically made up of fragments of coral, a large limestone deposit eventually formed in the area. Today, you can still find several fossilized plants and animals in the caves\u0027 limestone that date back to a time before dinosaurs walked the earth. Starting sometime between four and six million years ago, water began moving through the cracks in the stone deposit. This water combined with rainwater, and as a result of their chemical compositions, the two mixed to form a type of acid. This acid slowly dissolved the limestone to eventually form the winding caves that exist today in Carlsbad Caverns. This is a very common process that happens to limestone, many caves all around the world exist in limestone deposits due to the stone\u0027s solubility (the ability of a substance to be dissolved) in a mixture of water and acid. Eventually, speleothems, formations that arise from mineral deposits in caves, began to take shape in the lower levels of the caverns. In fact, these speleothems existed during the last ice age, when instead of a desert, a pine forest sat above the caves. Over the years, park employees and rangers have found clues that hint at the caves\u0027 history. For example, according to the National Park Service, people have found some bones of ancient ice age animals scattered around the entrance to some of the caves. In 2003, an employee found a part of a stone scraper dating back to the last ice age near a cave entrance as well. Clearly, the caves have a long history, researchers have discovered that American Indians first inhabited the area sometime between 12,000 and 14,000 years ago. Ever since then, the caves have been explored by several groups, including Spanish explorers in the 15005, and later by American explorers and guides who drew attention from all across the country to the natural phenomenon. Laurel remembers this phenomenon very well. \"It took us between one and two hours to get all the way to the bottom,\" she says, recounting the windy pathway leading deeper and deeper into the heart of the caves. \"The park had put in blue and red lights to highlight the beautiful rock formations.\" Once they reached the bottom, Laurel says that she had to take an elevator to get back to the top. \"My ears popped so much in the elevator she remembers. \"It took a really long time to reach the top; I didn\u0027t realize how far down we were until we were on our way back up.\" "

        "text": "Right now, people are planning a one-way trip to Mars. Elon Musk, an inventor and businessman, is in charge of a long trip through space. He founded a company to build spacecraft. He plans on using those spacecraft to bring 80,000 people to the \"red planet,\" Mars. Musk believes the human race is in danger. He thinks that we\u0027re running out of room and resources on this planet. He\u0027s worried that humans could someday go extinct, like dinosaurs. Even today, around 200 different life forms on Earth go extinct every single day. Musk wants people to live on many planets someday, so he is building rockets to take us there. Many people are interested in Musk\u0027s company and want to know more about flying through outer space. Getting to Mars, however, is only half the challenge. Right now, it\u0027s impossible for human beings to breathe on Mars. It\u0027s even impossible for human beings to walk around on Mars without a spacesuit. It is no place to live. So, if humans land on Mars, how will they survive? The answer to this question has a lot to do with biodiversity. Biodiversity is a term used to describe the number and kinds of different living things in one place. There are many kinds of life forms: humans, dogs and cats, birds, cows and other animals. Different kinds of plants should be counted as life forms, too. When scientists describe biodiversity, they don\u0027t just think about humans, plants and animals. They also think about the entire ecosystem, a whole community of living things from earth to sky, including bacteria and other kinds of organisms. And there can be thousands of kinds of life in the soil alone. Most of these life forms depend on one another to get by. If you go to Mars, how many of these life forms will you bring with you? How will you know what you need? This is why Elon Musk is trying hard to figure out how humans will grow plants on Mars. Over the years, human beings have learned that soil is one of the most important ecosystems on Earth. In just one handful of soil, there can be thousands of tiny life forms that all help one another survive. Soil allows plants to grow. The plants release oxygen, allowing animals and humans to breathe. And the entire ecosystem makes it possible for human beings to pick berries, go on hikes, and enjoy all the parts of nature. So, if we begin by bringing soil with us, maybe one day there will be a forest on Mars. "

There is a family though that has had five of its members play professional baseball, which is more than any other family in history. They are the Hairston family. Jerry Hairston, Jr. and his younger brother Scott have played on many baseball teams in the major leagues. Jerry has played for nine different teams, like the Baltimore Orioles and the New York Yankees. Scott played for the Oakland Athletics and another team in New York, the Mets. However, during the 2010 season, Jerry and Scott both played on the same team: The San Diego Padres. Scott was asked about how their parents felt now that they had the chance to watch both of their sons play in the same game for the same team. \"They love it. They\u0027re excited to come out and watch opening day, and watching the same game on TV is going to be something different,\" he told The Sporting News in 2010. Scott explained that usually their parents would have to change the channel back and forth so that they could watch Scott and Jerry play on the same night. Watching TV became much easier for the Hairston family then!Hairston, Sr. is the father of Scott and Jerry, Jr. He played on a few different major league baseball teams in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1983, Jerry, Sr. played an important part in an exciting game. The pitcher of that game was named Milt Wilcox. He only needed one more out for a perfect game, which is when a pitcher gets every single batter out in a game. Jerry, Sr. came up to bat and got the first base hit for his team. Wilcox was probably not very happy that Jerry, Sr. ruined his chance at pitching a perfect game! Jerry Hairston, Sr. also had a brother play in the major leagues. Johnny Hairston is the uncle of Scott and Jerry, Jr. Like Scott, Johnny played for the Chicago Cubs, but Johnny was on the team in 1969. Johnny only played for a very short time. He played in three games and got one base hit. Johnny and Jerry, Sr.\u0027s father also played baseball! His name was Sam Hairston and he played for the Chicago White Sox in 1951. The grandfather of Scott and Jerry, Jr. was the first black man to ever play for that team after he played in the Negro Leagues for many years. That is the story of the Hairstons: a family that has had three generations of major league baseball players. "

        "text": "In Edmonton, Alberta, public transportation is not a great option for getting around. Up until early 2013, there was only one subway that went along a single route, back and forth. The bus system was complicated and not too reliable. If you were a young lady who liked to go places in the city, see friends and music, and have fun, the best option was often a bicycle. This is how The Precious Metals came to be. They were almost certainly Edmonton\u0027s first and only all-girl bicycle gang; Katie, Marissa, Amanda, and Caycee. Whitney was the unofficial fifth member; her house was often a gathering place before and after rides. Caycee and Amanda were the leaders. After classes at university, the girls would repair bikes and learn about how they worked. Each of them ended up building a custom bicycle from the spare parts of other models. They decorated each one with tassels, glitter paint, panniers and baskets. The baskets were especially useful for carrying boom boxes. The Precious Metals didn\u0027t have much of a uniform. They usually biked in dresses they got from a store called Nokomis, which is the Cree word for \"grandmother.\" \"We also had matching denim jackets that no one ever got around to embroidering,\" remembers Caycee. They were recognizable wherever they went; imitators soon followed, but it was impossible to recreate the spirit of loyalty that held them together. As a gang, their activities were pretty innocent. Mostly, they rode to and from events, playing music and having adventures. Sometimes they would make stencils and wheatpastings, and go out to decorate the old abandoned industrial buildings. The stencils were mostly images, like a pair of cowboy boots, but sometimes there were messages, too. Amanda would write, \"I love you to the bone.\" Next to it, Caycee would write, \"I love you to the marrow.\" Sometimes boys would ride with them, but as Caycee remembers it, \"the whole idea of The Precious Metals was to be independent. Nobody needed to walk us home or offer us a place to stay if it got too late. We had our bikes and each other.\" This was a big deal for a girl of any age living in Edmonton. Without many good options for getting around, it was easy to end up relying on good luck and the goodwill of others for getting around town. Being able to go places totally on your own steam was a special thing, and it brought with it a unique feeling of power. \"If you were a Precious Metal, your journey was always your own,\" said Caycee. \"In a complicated world full of things that were impossible to control, having your own wheels and your best friends riding with you really made a difference.\" When Amanda moved to Vancouver, the gang disbanded, but the denim jackets and the bikes are still in fine condition.

        "text": "When Tommy Owen, a tour guide in the Everglades National Park, saw the animal, he immediately went after it. Owen was giving a tour of Florida\u0027s famous national park wetlands. He and a group of tourists were floating in a boat through the shallow water that makes up the Everglades. One of the women in the boat he was steering saw a snake in the water. She got Tommy\u0027s attention and pointed the snake out to him. When Tommy saw the snake, he acted fast. He reached into the water and grabbed the animal by the head. He got a good grip and didn\u0027t let go. Tourists in the boat were worried when the snake wrapped itself around Tommy\u0027s arm. After several minutes, he got control of the animal and removed it from the water. The snake was a ten-foot-Long Burmese python. It was a snake not native to Florida and, quite simply, it didn\u0027t belong there.The Florida Everglades teem with life. Situated at the southern end of the state, between Lake Okeechobee and the Gulf Coast, the Everglades are the largest wilderness east of the Mississippi River. Migratory and wading birds tiptoe through marshy grasslands. Orchids and ferns dot the hardwood forests. Alligators lounge in the shallows and on muddy riverbanks. Mangrove leaves rustle in the wind as the brackish water laps at their roots. All of this life is made possible by the presence of water. The Everglades is a natural region of subtropical wetlands. Water flows from the Kissimmee River into the wide, shallow Lake Okeechobee. From there the lake drains south, into the Everglades marsh and the Florida flats. The Everglades are sometimes called the \"River of Grass\" after a book of the same name by author Marjory Stoneman Douglas. The phrase illustrates the fact that the Everglades are basically a very wide and shallow river. The Florida Everglades once covered 11,000 acres across the southern end of the state. Wetlands are an important ecosystem. For centuries, however, humans thought of wetlands as unhygienic swamps. Draining the Everglades was suggested in the late 19th century. As soon as Florida became a state in 1845, its legislature asked permission from Congress to drain the Everglades. Canals were dug to remove or redirect the water. Land that dried out was reclaimed for agriculture or building purposes. This reclamation allowed for significant development in south Florida. Sugar farmers moved into the area and prospered. The city of Miami took root. Approximately 50% of the Everglades has been reclaimed for agricultural or urban use. Much of the northern area has been polluted with phosphorus. This phosphorus is agricultural runoff from the farms near the Everglades. Concerned Floridians had been advocating for saving the area since the 1930s. Their efforts paid off in 1947 when Congress created the Everglades National Park. Starting in the late 1970s environmental concerns at both the national and international levels refocused attention on the Everglades. The area was designated as one of the world\u0027s most important wetland areas. Since then efforts have been underway to safeguard the park and return the Everglades to health. Water levels are monitored, as are nutrient levels in both water and soil samples. This has been the largest environmental conservation project in the history of the United States. Much of it is designed to reverse-engineer the canal system that was built in the 19th and mid-20th centuries. Ecological indicators are showing some improvements. The crayfish population is up. Wading and migratory birds have improved their nesting habits. Despite all the good news, the Everglades now face a new threat.The Burmese python is native to tropical and subtropical zones in Southeast Asia. In their native habitat, Burmese pythons are nocturnal carnivores. When they live close to human habitations, pythons eat rats, mice, and rabbits that are attracted to human dwellings and farms. They can also eat small farm animals like chickens. When they live away from human habitations, pythons eat birds and small wild mammals. The python is a solitary animal. The python kills by constricting its body around its prey. Python eggs and hatchlings are a food source for other animals. In the wild, pythons grow to be on average 12 feet long. (Habitat loss and the exotic pet trade in Asia are depleting the python\u0027s numbers in the Asian wild.) In the United States the Burmese python is a popular pet. Docile and beautifully patterned in brown and gold diamond shapes, these snakes can be purchased at pet stores or reptile shows. Owners keep them in cages or tanks and feed them rats or mice. Most people buy pythons when the animals are small. Pythons can grow very quickly. For many pet owners, the pet pythons become too big to manage. The first Burmese python was found in the Florida Everglades in 1979. It\u0027s presumed the animal was originally kept as a pet and then released by its owner. Starting in 1992, when it\u0027s thought that numerous Burmese pythons escaped pet stores and cages damaged in Hurricane Andrew, the numbers have grown at a faster rate. The Burmese pythons that have been released in southern Florida have found a habitat they like in the Everglades. They are breeding in the Everglades and have reached numbers that designate them as an invasive species. Pythons are eating machines. They can eat anything from deer to bobcats, to raccoons to alligators. They especially enjoy dining on small mammals and birds. Studies have shown that since their appearance in the Everglades, the numbers of small mammals in the area are down significantly. Additionally, this population loss is not observed in areas where the python has not established itself. Many agencies and individuals are trying to put a stop to the python invasion. The National Park Service has begun a program to study these animals in the Florida Everglades. Park Service scientists have implanted tracking devices into seventeen large pythons that were later re-released into the wild. They have provided scientists with information regarding python behavior. In 2013 the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation program issued permits to hunt the snakes within state wildlife-managed areas of the Everglades. Sixty-eight animals were captured. In the meantime, python records are still being broken. In May of 2013 Jason Leon was driving in a rural area near Florida City when he spotted a python\u0027s head protruding from the brush. The man was a biologist, and was familiar with pythons. He approached the snake and pulled it out of the bush. The animal was bigger than he expected. After a struggle with the animal, Leon killed it. The python was 18 feet long and 128 pounds. Leon contacted the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, who agreed to pick up and examine the snake. The snake was found to be the largest ever in the state of Florida. The state later issued a statement: \"Jason Leon\u0027s nighttime sighting and capture of a Burmese python of more than 18 feet in length is a notable accomplishment that set a Florida record. The Florida Wildlife Commission is grateful to him both for safely removing such a large Burmese python, and for reporting its capture."

        "text": "Donald Seastrunk never feared the jugglers until they upgraded from bean bags to bowling pins. By the movie theater, after a movie let out, excited crowds gathered around the most skilled jugglers, whose silk vests were as blue as the sky. Winking and smiling, the jugglers performed astonishing feats: dozens of balls in the air at once; nifty, behind-the-back and through-the-legs tricks; even juggling blindfolded. Word of mouth spread to neighboring towns. People from far away came to see the street performers. All seemed well and good, but with the jugglers\u0027 popularity came copycats. And so many of them! On the side streets and quiet walkways, juggling copycats blundered through their simple routines. A ball or two rolling into the street was the worst of it, at first. But when the very best jugglers switched to bowling pins to freshen up their act, the bad jugglers copied this, too. For Donald Seastrunk, the juggling problem came to a head one May morning, as he hurried from his car up the path to the library. Just as he thought he was safe, a stray bowling pin spiraled through the air and whomped him on the head. The next day it was crazy at Town Hall, too. Mayor Marjorie Arnold sighed at her desk. She had just read Donald Seastrunk\u0027s angry email, which Donald had sent to dozens of friends, the town council, and the mayor\u0027s office. This wasn\u0027t the first complaint the mayor had received about the jugglers. But what could she do? Some people were mad, but others loved the jugglers. After all, the town was practically famous now, and people were proud to be from a famous town. The biggest newspaper in the state capital had even written an article about the jugglers. And think of all the money the crowds spent at local stores! The mayor chewed her pen. She tapped her foot furiously. She sighed so strongly that important documents blew off her desk, and this made her sigh again. Whenever she found herself in trouble, Mayor Arnold liked to hold imaginary conversations with the golden cat statue on her desk. With another heavy sigh, she asked it for advice. \"Why not pass a law banning juggling in public?\" it seemed to say. \"The mayor can\u0027t just pass whatever laws she wants,\" said Mayor Arnold. \"Laws are passed by the town council With a groan, the mayor rose from her leather chair and stood at the window, looking at the trees in full bloom on the town green. One tree had a bowling pin caught in the branches. The mayor imagined the cat\u0027s voice dropping to a whisper. \"Why not order the police to fine the jugglers for disturbing the peace?\" \"That\u0027s no good,\" the mayor said. She rested her forehead on the cool window and closed her eyes. \"What if the jugglers sue us? Then the case would go to court, and the town could lose a lot of money!\" The golden cat statue made no reply. The mayor was by herself. She heard what sounded like the distant rumble of thunder. Thunder? There wasn\u0027t a cloud in the sky! Without taking her forehead off the window, Mayor Arnold opened her eyes. What she saw next made her jump up with a squeak. A crowd of people were marching up the long street that led to Town Hall, and at the crowd\u0027s front was Donald Seastrunk himself. They pumped their fists in the air and waved signs. An anti-juggler protest! Mayor Arnold sighed. It was going to be a long day. "

        "author": "By W.M. Akers",
        "metadata": "Grade: 4 Lexile: 400L",
        "text": "\"Holy cow!\" said Brian. \"That\u0027s not a cow,\" said Kara. \"It\u0027s a water buffalo.\" \"So what? It\u0027s still pretty cool.\" Kara was not impressed. She and her family had been at the Zoo for three hours. They hadn\u0027t seen anything good. First there were mountain lions. They were boring. They just looked like big versions of the cats they had at home. Next was the insect house: a bunch of dark rooms full of creepy, crawly, disgusting bugs. Worst of all was the archaeology exhibit. It was nothing but rocks! The Zoo could have been fun if it weren\u0027t so hot out. Kara was surprised the water buffalo weren\u0027t being boiled alive. Sweat streamed down her face as they finally started walking towards the next exhibit. It tasted salty and gross. Her feet got heavier with every step. If she didn\u0027t start having fun soon, she was probably going to die. It didn\u0027t help that Brian was so cheerful. He had been begging to go to the Zoo for months. When Mom told him they were going, he got so happy that he started sneezing. It took him ten minutes to stop. Every animal they saw, Brian got more excited. It\u0027s like he didn\u0027t know how boring animals could be. He kept saying things like, \"Wow! Mountain lions!\" or \"What a cool bug!\" or \"Hey Kara, come look at these rocks!\" Brian was two years older than Kara, but at the Zoo he turned into a little baby. \"I\u0027m thirsty,\" said Kara. \"We\u0027ll get lunch soon,\" said Mom. \"Do I have to wait for lunch? My mouth feels like the desert.\" Brian\u0027s eyes lit up. \"That reminds me!\" he said. \"There\u0027s a whole exhibit about desert animals. We\u0027ll get to see sand worms!\" \"Mom,\" said Kara. \"That will be boring.\" She stretched out the \"O\" in boring, so that it took almost a minute to say. Booooooooooooooooooring. When she was finished, her mom smiled. \"Let\u0027s try to have fun,\" she said. \"I think there\u0027s a water fountain over there.\" Kara stomped her way to the water fountain. \"Stupid Zoo,\" she said. \"Stupid big brother. Stupid desert exhibit. Stupid sand worms!\" She drank water until her stomach hurt. This made her feel better. \"Maybe if I get a bad enough stomachache,\" she thought to herself, \"they\u0027ll have to take me to the hospital. And maybe the doctors will tell Mom that I can\u0027t go to the zoo ever again.\" She tried drinking enough water to make herself sick. It didn\u0027t work. She just got her hair all wet. She was about to start drinking again when Mom shouted. \"Kara! Come on!\" \"Yeah, Kara!\" shouted Brian. \"They\u0027re feeding the sand worms in ten minutes. I don\u0027t wanna miss it!\" Kara ran after them. It was hard with her stomach full of water. She had just caught up when a sign caught her eye. It said: Meet the Giant Gorilla! Today only. One O\u0027clock, at the monkey house. \"Mom?\" she said.\"Mom! Mom!\" This time, Kara dragged the O in Mom out so that it took almost two minutes to say. Moooooooooooooooooooooooooooom. \"Yes?\" said Mom. \"I want to meet the giant gorilla.\" \"Oh really? I thought you hated the Zoo.\" \"I do! But I like people. Gorillas are practically people.\"\"There\u0027s no time for that!\" said Brian. \"We\u0027ve gotta see the sand worms.\"\"Please Mom?\" said Kara. \"It\u0027s the only thing at this stupid Zoo that will be any fun.\" \"I don\u0027t know...\" said Mom. \"It\u0027s today only.\" \"Okay.\" Inside the monkey house, a long line of people waited to meet the giant gorilla. Normally Kara hated waiting, but this would be worth it. It\u0027s one thing to look at animals all day, to see them sleeping and eating and doing all that boring stuff. But to meet a gorilla is something nobody ever gets to do. Kara hummed while she waited. \"Please stop humming,\" said Brian. \"I can\u0027t,\" said Kara. \"Gorillas love music. He\u0027ll expect me to be humming.\" \"That\u0027s not true,\" said Brian. \"You don\u0027t know anything about gorillas.\" Brian was grumpy because they were missing the sand worms. Kara didn\u0027t care. Everyone knows gorillas are better than sand worms. But he was right, she didn\u0027t know anything about gorillas. What if it was scary? What if it was mean? What if it bit her hand? Kara wouldn\u0027t tell Brian, but as the line inched forward, she got more and more frightened. By the time it was her turn, she was sweating almost as much as she had outside. \"Go ahead, Kara,\" said Mom. \"It\u0027s time to meet the giant gorilla.\" Kara was about to ask to leave, to say she was too scared, to quit. But one look at her brother convinced her not to chicken out. \"All right,\" she said. \"I love gorillas.\" She turned the corner, her toes trembling and her palms sweating, and there was the ape. \"Holy cow,\" she muttered. She had expected the gorilla to be scary. To be tough. To be mean. But instead, it was beautiful, with a long flat face, round sloping shoulders, and nostrils big enough to hold a cigar. It looked at her with big, brown eyes and yawned. \"He\u0027s pretty sleepy today,\" said the zookeeper. \"He drank too much water.\" \"I know how he feels,\" said Kara. \"It\u0027s a boy?\" \"An old man. Over thirty years old.\" \"What\u0027s his name?\" \"Christopher. Do you want to shake his hand?\" \"It isn\u0027t dangerous?\" \"He\u0027s been doing this a long time. Never hurt anybody yet. Come on, Christopher. Say hello!\" The gorilla stuck out its hand. Kara took it in her sweaty palm. It was soft, cool, and gentle. It looked like Christopher was smiling. She laughed. \"I think we\u0027re going to be friends!\" she said. \"I think you already are,\" said the keeper. "

        "text": "Fle adWorkscrg Siblings- Siblings Mikey was eating breakfast on a Saturday morning when her mom came into the kitchen to ask where her older brother was. \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said. \"He\u0027s probably playing video games.\" She slurped another mouthful of cereal off her spoon and heard her mom calling to Henry to get out of the basement for once. She turned the page of the book she was reading. Henry had turned 16 a few weeks before, and since then, he had spent most of his weekends sodas, and a beat, up, old futon their dad had in college. The washing machine and dryer were also located down there, and Mikey knew her mom hated it when Henry wouldn\u0027t leave the basement long enough for her to do the laundry in peace. Their morn walked back into the kitchen and sat down across the table from Mikey. \"I just don\u0027t understand that boy anymore,\" she said. \"Does he talk to you?\" \"He stopped talking to me in the third grade, when he started coming home late on school days,\" Mikey said. She shrugged and put her book down. They used to be best friends, Mikey and Henry. They took their golden retriever Scout on long walks through the undeveloped forest area behind their house every day after school. They would pretend to be in Middle Earth, like the characters from the Lord of the Rings series (which Henry used to read obsessively). Mikey was basically interested in anything Henry was and happy to be Gollum or an orc or whatever evil creature Henry felt like vanquishing that day. (Scout was always on Mikey\u0027s side, because she had a disadvantage, being younger than Henry and the evil character.) When it got dark, they would make their way back through the trees to the wide lawn in the backyard of their house, and then in through the sliding glass doors to the kitchen for a snack. Henry liked to eat peanut butter sandwiches and would make three: two for him and one for Mikey. Their mom would come home a little while later, and they would pretend to be starving for dinner. But at some point in the last year, everything changed. Henry started making plans with his friends after school, and the house would be empty, except for Scout, when Mikey was dropped off from carpool after school. Sometimes Henry didn\u0027t come home until after Mikey and her parents were already sitting down to eat dinner. It soon became Mikey\u0027s job to take Scout on a walk by herself, but it was becoming winter, and the sun was setting early, and Mikey was nervous to go into the undeveloped woods by herself. \"Really, Mom, the person it bothers the most is Scout. She absolutely hates having to walk on the streets in the neighborhood. Dogs were made for running around trees, not for walking on asphalt.\" Mikey shrugged again. Her morn smiled at her sadly and reached across the table to take Mikey\u0027s cheek in her hand, but Mikey brushed it off quickly. She always did that when she felt sorry for Mikey. \"I\u0027m sorry, sweetie,\" she said. \"Do you want me and Dad to talk to Henry about Scout\u0027s predicament?\" Mikey shook her head emphatically. \"He would just resent Scout,\" she said. Her morn nodded. \"Maybe. I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll grow out of this phase soon.\" Mikey picked her book up again. \"I doubt it,\" she said. Her mom stood up and left the kitchen. Sunlight was streaming in through the big windows that surrounded the room, and Scout was lying in a patch of warmth under Mikey\u0027s chair. She supposed this was how it would always be: her and Scout, hanging out and growing old together as if Henry had never existed. Suddenly, the whirring sound of the washing machine rose up from the basement. Henry walked into the kitchen and sat down where their mom was sitting before. \"Hey, Mikey,\" he said. \"Want to take Scout on a walk?\" Mikey put her book down and smiled. \"Sure,\" she said. "

        "text": "Living things like plants, animals, and people need energy to survive and grow. People eat food for energy, but most plants use energy that they get from sunlight. When you look at plants such as a tree, flower, or grass, what do you see? You might notice their stems, trunks, branches, leaves, roots, or flowers, but how do they grow? What are they made from? How did the plant make those parts? Life is a puzzle in many ways. People don\u0027t all agree on how life started or why it exists. Yet a simple way of thinking about how plants grow is to think of the plant itself as a piece of a larger puzzle. Each plant is a part of its unique environment. Different environments could be oceans, forests, deserts, or cities. Each environment also has its own climate, which is partially based on how much sun and rain an area receives every year. Since only certain plants grow in hot, cool, wet, or dry climates, each environment is made up of different types of plant life. A desert may grow palm trees and cacti, while a forest may grow tall pines or oak trees. In order for a plant to grow, it needs three very important puzzle pieces: water, carbon dioxide, and light. Plants use their roots to take in water from the ground. They use their leaves to take in sunlight and carbon dioxide from the air. Plants use these three puzzle pieces to make their own food in a process called photosynthesis. Using the energy from the sun, plants convert water and carbon dioxide into sugar. This sugar feeds the plant\u0027s growth from a seedling into an adult. In the process, the plant releases oxygen into the air. Another important piece to the growth of many plants is soil. Using their roots, plants take in nutrients from the soil that help them grow. Giving a plant a spot in clean soil is important to make sure it doesn\u0027t absorb anything harmful from the dirt. Plants make their food from carbon dioxide, water and light. They use this food to grow stems, trunks, roots, branches, leaves, and flowers. Now when you look at a tree, flower, or even a blade of grass, you can see all the pieces ofthe plant and how the entire puzzle fits together. "

        "text": "In a jungle there was a large cool pond where many animals came to drink. Tall animals like giraffes, and small animals like meerkats all came to this pond and drank from the water together. Each species had its own section at the pond: the zebras did not drink by the cranes, and the elephants did not drink by the monkeys. It was a very peaceful place. One day a hippopotamus came to the pond and bent to drink some water right where the giraffes usually drank. None of the other animals had ever seen him before. They were frightened: he was really big and did not seem to care about the rules of the pond. \"We should tell him to go away!\" a meerkat whispered to a monkey. The monkey nodded. They were both much smaller than the hippopotamus, and they were very nervous about getting eaten by him. You see, since none of the animals had ever seen a hippopotamus, they did not know what it liked to eat. It was very important that all of the animals in the jungle knew what the others\u0027 preferred foods were, so that they could protect themselves. The zebras knew to stay away from the lions who preyed on them; and the mice knew to stay hidden under the trees, away from the large birds who swooped down to eat them. All of the animals in the jungle grew up learning about the food chain. This food chain was a part of life: the animals who were eaten provided important nutrients for the animals that ate them, like proteins and fat that helped the eaters to grow. How do you think lions become so big and strong? A giraffe came up to where the meerkat and monkey stood by the pond and leaned its long head down to talk to them. \"Do you think he eats plants?\" the giraffe asked worriedly. Giraffes only eat plants, and because the hippopotamus was so close to the ground, this giraffe was afraid he would eat all the plants before they could grow tall enough for the giraffes to eat. A zebra skipped up to the group, still in a huddle. \"You have nothing to worry about, Meerkat and Monkey!\" he said. \"It looks like the new guy likes plants. Sorry Giraffe.\" The four animals looked over to the hippopotamus, now about a third of the way into the pond, chomping on some very green leaves with a content and happy expression on his face. "
