        "text": "Tom had to fix some things around the house. He had to fix the door. He had to fix the window. But before he did anything he had to fix the toilet. Tom called over his best friend Jim to help him. Jim brought with him his friends Molly and Holly. Tom thought that Jim was going to bring Dolly with him but he didn\u0027t. The four of them got to work right away. Fixing the toilet was easy. Fixing the door was also easy but fixing the window was very hard. The window was stuck and could not be opened. They all pushed on the window really hard until finally it opened. Once the window was fixed the four of them made a delicious dinner and talked about all of the good work that they had done. Tom was glad that he had such good friends to help him with his work."

Whiskers likes to sleep in the sun on her favorite chair. Whiskers also likes to drink creamy milk.  Lisa is excited because on Saturday, Whiskers turns two years old.  After school on Friday, Lisa rushes to the pet store. She wants to buy Whiskers\u0027 birthday presents. Last year, she gave Whiskers a play mouse and a blue feather.  For this birthday, Lisa is going to give Whiskers a red ball of yarn and a bowl with a picture of a cat on the side. The picture is of a black cat. It looks a lot like Whiskers."

And then the other boy was named Alex, and he was handsome and cool. They were opposites, but they didn\u0027t care. Alex would always protect James from the bullies because James was weak.  One day, James was being teased by the bullies, Gordon and Johnny, but Alex wasn\u0027t there to save him. James didn\u0027t know what to do and was scared. But then he remembered all of the times Alex stood up for him. James looked up to Alex and he thought of him as his hero. James wanted to protect himself and not have Alex always come to help. So this time, James got up and was brave. He stood up to Gordon and Johnny and told them that he wasn\u0027t scared. The bullies didn\u0027t know what to do and then gave up. They went away to look for more fun things to do. Alex saw the whole thing and was proud of James for being brave.  Now James and Alex protect each other and stand up for each other. They still are the best of friends."

Pawn did not very much care for chess as he was very bored with it. Another problem Pawn had was that he didn\u0027t like some of the other people in this land. They had names like Bishop, Queen, Rook, and Knight. And most of all, there was King. He was the greatest person in Board. One day, during their normal battle, Pawn saw an opening to move to the far end of Board. He almost got hurt by Knight but he got away. Amazingly, when he got to the other end he became as powerful as Queen. With this amazing power, Pawn chose to help keep King safe. All was well until Pawn woke up and knew that it was only a dream.

James has been lazy in practicing so he is not very good at baseball right now.  He has to make up for it by playing baseball for 5 hours every day for a week.  James thinks this is enough practice for him to catch up and be a good player when the season starts.  So James and Tommy practice every day.  They throw the ball around.  They practice batting and they practice fielding.  Tommy begins to see that James is getting better every day.  He says \\\"I do not believe it, James, but I think you are going to be pretty good when the season starts!\\\"  Usually a week is not enough time to get pretty good at baseball but James is practicing so much he is fitting a month of practice into one week.  Then James has a setback.  His glove rips during practice.  He can\u0027t keep playing with a broken glove!  So Tommy and James go around town collecting bottles to trade in for five cents for each bottle.  James misses a day of practicing but they find enough bottles to turn in for thirty dollars.  This is enough money for James to buy a new glove!  So James buys a new glove and he and Tommy go back to the field and practice some more.  By the time the season comes James is one of the best players on his team."

It took us almost half an hour, but we finally got the kite into the air. As it lifted into the sky, the kite caught the edge of my jacket and I was pulled up into the wind with the kite. I flew higher and higher into the air until I my dad looked like an ant on the ground. The park was beautiful from up high, and I could see our car getting smaller. I flew all the way out of the city and over the lake. Eventually, the wind started to die down and I fell closer to the water. I called out to some people on a boat and they sailed over so I could land on their boat. I told them about my adventure and they sailed me back to land, where my dad picked me up. He took me out for ice cream and we went home."

Jacob would always bring his puppy too. Jacob\u0027s puppy was named Sally. Thomas and  Jacob would run around the back yard and Rudy and Sally chased them and barked. They all had so much fun playing together. One day, Thomas told Rudy that tomorrow would be a very special day. It would be Rudy\u0027s birthday. Rudy was very excited. The next day came and Thomas threw a birthday party for Rudy. All of Rudy\u0027s friends were there and they had presents for him. Jacob brought Rudy a new ball and Sally brought him a bone. There was one more present for Rudy to open. When he opened the gift from Thomas, Rudy was so exited that he jumped and barked. It was a new red collar with a shiny name tag on it. It was the best gift Rudy had ever been given."

        "text": "The first grade class went on a bus to visit a farm. The farm was a long ways from their school. The farm was also far away from any other farms or houses. The farmers who lived there were the Nixon family. They grew corn. Sometimes when the weather was right, they would plant wheat, too. The fields were so large that the class could not see where they ended. Mr. Nixon gave all of the children a long ride in the fields on his tractor. The Nixon family also had a lot of farm animals. In the red barn next to their home, they kept a few cows and horses. Everyone fed hay to some of the cows. The farmers got milk from their cows. Some of the class got small bottles of fresh milk to take home with them. All the kids got to ride on the big brown horses the Nixons had. They went up into the nearby hills, where they could look down on the farm below. Around the farmyard there were many goats and chickens, who wandered around as they wished. The Nixon children liked to play with their goats, feed them peanut shells and pet them, like the first grade kids did with their dogs and cats. The smallest tried to bump the children with their hard heads and tiny horns! When it was almost dark, the school kids got back on the bus to go home. They were a little sad to leave the fun life of the farm children. But they brought back stories for all the rest of the school to hear."

        "text": "I used to be afraid of butterflies!  It is true!  Once, my mom took me to Seattle.  There, we went to a special place.  We went to the zoo!  I saw lots of animals at the zoo.  I saw bears.  I saw tigers.  I saw apes.  I saw monkeys.  I saw snakes.  I loved seeing all these animals.  They made me happy.  We even saw one place where there were giant bugs and they didn\u0027t even scare me.  In fact, I like bugs.  But there was one place where you walked inside a big room where there were lots of plants and butterflies flying all over the place.  You could buy sugar water to feed them and they could land on you.  My mom and brother were so excited to go in, but I was scared.  I wasn\u0027t sure that I wanted to be in the room with butterflies flying everywhere.  My mom said I would be okay.  My brother said I would be okay.  They said butterflies were nice and beautiful.  They said they would not hurt me.  So I went in the room.  Guess what?  I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door! The man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at me to stop.  He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies.  I said I was sorry, but I was scared.  He checked me for butterflies and then let me get out of there!  I stayed outside and my mom and my brother enjoyed the butterflies.  Since then, they would tease me about being afraid.  They would try and get me to not be afraid.  Last year for my birthday, mom bought me a butterfly book.  She bought one for my brother, too.  I tried really hard to not be afraid and to go out into the yard and find butterflies with my brother.  It became really fun to do.  Once, a butterfly landed on me and I laughed.  I liked it.  It tickled me.  It did not hurt me.  Now, I like butterflies!"

John was very nice and he liked the same games as Buddy. Mary watched Buddy chase after a ball John threw. She could tell John was a nice man. She wanted to play too. Buddy saw her watching and led his new friend over to Mary. John waved to Mary and brought her a flower. Mary smiled at him. She thought he was very kind and she wasn\u0027t as nervous as before.

Laura and George played basketball they saw the ice cream man driving in his truck. George asked Laura if she wanted him to buy her an ice cream cone. Laura said she would like him to do that. Laura sat on the bench as George walked to the ice cream truck. Laura looked in the sky and saw a pretty bird flying in a large circle. The bird flew away. George came back with two ice cream cones. One of the ice cream cones had rainbow sprinkles on it. George gave the ice cream cone with sprinkles to Laura. George and Laura sat on the bench and watched a group of boys play football as they ate their ice cream cones. One of the boys broke his leg.

When the people of the town went out they loved to wear hats but never wore shoes and the hats were also many different colors, shapes and sizes. On Sundays all the families in town would go to the park by the river and have picnics. The children would run, skip and play and the parents would talk, eat and laugh. The children loved the picnic foods they had. There were hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken and steak. They also had salads, coleslaw, fries and chips. The kids\u0027 favorite was hamburgers with fries.  On days when it rained the children and parents would stay inside and read or color pictures and drink hot chocolate and they loved to wear big warm sweaters. At night the family would all go to the kitchen and cook dinner together and after dinner was finished they would all clear the table and clean the dishes together before getting ready for bed. They would put their pajamas on but never wear socks and they would get under the covers and fall asleep."

Lauren picked Chocolate up to help her cross the street, because Lauren knew that turtles are very slow and cars are very fast.  After Lauren got Chocolate to the other side of the road, Chocolate peeked her head out of her shell and looked at the little girl.  Lauren saw that not only was Chocolate\u0027s shell worn, one of her eyes was shut.  Lauren thought Chocolate needed more help from her, so Lauren took the turtle home.  Lauren hid Chocolate in her bathtub, because she was worried that her mother would be mad. Lauren went to look up what turtles like to eat and left Chocolate alone in the bathtub.  Lauren was still looking up  turtle facts when she heard her mother call out, \\\"Lauren, get in here now!\\\"  Lauren knew she was in trouble.  But when Lauren came into the bathroom, her mother was smiling.  Lauren\u0027s mom told her that she had a turtle when she was a little girl.  Lauren and her mom took Chocolate to an animal doctor who treated sick turtles.  The doctor gave them special drops to put in Chocolate\u0027s eyes.  Lauren put the drops in Chocolate\u0027s eyes, like the doctor told her and soon the turtle\u0027s eyes were all better. Chocolate\u0027s shell was still old and worn looking, like an old shoe, but now her eyes were beautiful, like the golden jewels on Grandma\u0027s earrings. Lauren was glad that she helped Chocolate."

Jake plays first base and Jimmy is a pitcher.  They both love baseball.  They started playing when they were four years old.  It is so fun for them.  Their team has won three games so far.  They beat the Jets, the Bluejays, and the Hawks so far.  They have not lost any games yet.  They are playing the Tigers today.  The Tigers have not lost any games either.  The score was one to one until the last inning.  There were two outs.  Jimmy came to the plate.  The pitcher named Johnny threw the ball hard.  Jimmy swung his bat too late and missed.  He missed the next pitch too.  It was too fast.  He was ready for the next pitch.  He hit it hard to center field.  The Tiger player in center field jumped to catch it, but it went over his head and over the fence.  It was a home run!  The Knights won the game!"

There were cat policemen, cat firemen, cat teachers, and even a cat bus driver. Most of the cats were very busy.     The King of Catatonia was a small cat named Diggs. He had two brothers named Pouncer and Flash who helped him rule in Catatonia. Pouncer was head of the Milk, Cheese and Cream center and Flash\u0027s job was to blow things up. Together the three of them made sure all the cats were happy, had plenty to drink and got to enjoy bright fireworks shows in the distance.      One day Pouncer\u0027s wife brought the kittens to see Pouncer at his office. There were white kittens and lots of black and white spotted kittens walking around in the Milk, Cheese and Cream center.     Well that is all the time we have for now. I hope this short story of the Cats of Catatonia made at least one person in the room smile."

She didn\u0027t like anything about sewing quilts and blankets because it took too long. One quilt or blanket took a week to make, when a skirt or shirt took one night! Mary\u0027s mother didn\u0027t understand why Mary didn\u0027t like to sew quilts and blankets because Mary\u0027s mother loved to!  Mary was a normal little girl even if her friends didn\u0027t think so all the time. Mary\u0027s friends liked to play games and play outside but all Mary liked was to sew. She woke up and she began to sew. She only stopped to eat and use the bathroom. Mary\u0027s father was very worried about Mary. He said that little girls needed to laugh and play, not sew all the time.   One day Mary\u0027s father took Mary\u0027s sewing things and gave them to the poor children. \\\"No more sewing, Mary!\\\" He said. He wanted her to go laugh and play with her friends instead of sew but instead of going outside to play she ran into her room and cried. Mary was very sad that she couldn\u0027t sew any more. Soon her friends came over to see why Mary hadn\u0027t come over to play like her father said she would. When they saw her crying on her bed they had to think of a way to cheer her up. Billy said that maybe they could let her sew at their houses. Abby thought it was a great idea. So then all Mary\u0027s friends bought sewing things with their money so that Mary would be happy again. When Mary\u0027s father saw Mary go to one of her friend\u0027s house he was very happy. Soon everyone was happy again."

This hurt Mary\u0027s feelings a lot. The girls kept on playing and Mary was trying to have fun, but all she felt like doing was crying. She couldn\u0027t believe that she had not been invited to Allison\u0027s birthday party. She thought that they were friends and if her best friend Cindy had been invited, why not her?  After recess was over, the class walked back into the school. Mary saw Allison in line and tried to smile, but it was hard. Cindy felt horrible now that she had talked about the party that her friend was not going to.  Mary found it hard to pay attention to the teacher now. She kept thinking over and over why Allison didn\u0027t invite her to the party. Did Mary do something to make Allison mad or to hurt her? She couldn\u0027t understand it. Her eyes started to get wet with tears. She was hoping that no one saw this. Mary thought she saw Allison looking at her in a funny way. Suddenly Mary felt like she was going to start crying. She reached into her desk to pull out some tissues. She felt a strange  piece of paper. She pulled it out and there was the invitation to Allison\u0027s party. It had gotten mixed up in her papers in her desk. She immediately started to smile. She smiled at Allison and at Cindy. Cindy gave her a puzzled look because she thought that Mary was sad.   At lunch Mary explained everything to Cindy. Then Mary, Allison, and Cindy all went off to play."

        "text": "A boy named Eduardo in a far away place is thinking about a girl he loves.  He is cold. It is snowing where he lives. He lives in Argentina.  It\u0027s warm where she lives in Hawaii. She eats fresh fruit.  Her shower is outdoors under the warm sun as red birds fly around her. It is nice, but she misses him.  She remembers he is very pretty. She wondered if he would really love her always,  because she is older.  He didn\u0027t care. Eduardo was poor, so he could not visit her.   Maybe a time machine would help!! She can give back her birthdays! But she didn\u0027t want to bring back any dinosaurs back by accident. Like last time.  Then an angel flew down from a star called the Pleiades to help her. His name was Eh. He said, \\\"close your eyes! Then remember the most happy you have ever felt! Let go of any thing that feels like clouds. Imagine puppies hugging you, and kitties purring with you. Imagine you are eating chocolate ice cream!  As long as you remember how to be happy  you can ALWAYS be as young as Eduardo! And you can think of GREAT ways you can see him again!\\\"  It worked! She had an idea. Someone in a place called MR was buying stories that people wrote. She wrote one about her \u0026 Eduardo!  It paid for her airplane ride. Wow.  Then they were together again. Hugging each other in happiness, they said, \\\"Thank you everyone,  for helping us!\\\""

        "text": "Once upon a time, there was a boy named Freddy.   And Freddy loved his mom very much, and his mom loved him very much too.  One day, Freddy went outside to ride his bike.  On the way out, his mother told him, \\\"Remember to wear your helmet,\\\" and Freddy grabbed his helmet and met his friends outside.  When he was putting on his helmet, his friends told him, \\\"Helmets are for girls!  You\u0027re not cool if you wear a helmet!\\\"  Freddy thought about what his mom told him, but he wanted to be cool like his friends, and he took off his helmet.  Freddy and his friends went on a long adventure, and they rode all the way to the top of the largest hill in their neighborhood.  Looking down, Freddy was scared.  He had never ridden down this hill before.  His friends said, \\\"What are you, scared?\\\"  Freddy did not want to come off as scared.  He hopped on his bicycle, and down he went.  Freddy started speeding up, going very, very fast.  He pressed his brakes, but oh no, his brakes weren\u0027t working.  Freddy, speeding down the hill, did not know what to do.  He got to the end of the hill and slammed right into a tree.  He awoke the next day in the hospital.  At the hospital, his mother was there.  Freddy opened his eyes and told his mom the whole story.  He told her how we would never do that again, and how he would always wear his helmet.  His mom gave him a big kiss on the forehead, and Freddy knew his mother was right in the beginning.  She didn\u0027t have to say it.  In the end, Freddy learned that it\u0027s important to not care what other people think, and those that think you\u0027re not cool because you wear a helmet are the ones that aren\u0027t cool in the first place."

        "text": "The other day Mitch went to the store to buy his mother a big turkey. Inside the store there was food all over! Mitch could not believe his own little eyes. From the first time Mitch woke up this morning he knew that he\u0027d be a big man someday, and getting a big turkey for his mother was the way in which he could show that he is a big man. The store had all kinds of food from chocolate bars to yummy radish. Mitch ran for the turkey section of the store with much force. \\\"Turkeys are good, yummy yummy in my tummy, I want to eat a big old turkey and then go to the bathroom several times!\\\" Mitch would cry out to strangers he met in the turkey section of the store. Then, four and a half seconds later, Mitch turned into a giant Walrus named Ted! No one knew how this could have happened, but the Walrus knew. A few years later, Mitch the now giant Walrus named Ted joined the circus and became a rich man with green in his heart. He could not think of anything else but making more money at his circus. One day Ted the giant Walrus, also known as Mitch the happy boy, remembered that his mother still wanted a big turkey for her late night breakfast. Now that Ted was a giant walrus making money hand over fist, he could buy his mommy a big old turkey for their night time breakfast. Ted the walrus also remembered that he had earlier built a time machine. Ted the giant walrus used his time machine to go back in time to buy his mother who was now a dog named Herbert. Ted\u0027s mother, Herbert loved the big turkey, but there was a small problem. Herbert the dog didn\u0027t have any teeth!"

        "text": "Late in the evening, the wind blew hard around the little house. The sound of the wind is like someone crying. It made the old woman nervous. She had not been getting much sleep lately, but with the wind making the spooky noise, she didn\u0027t know what else to do but lie down and try to rest a little.  Once she lay down to try to sleep, many memories of her life in the little house kept her mind busy. She still was having trouble falling asleep. She remembered being a little girl and her dad putting the finishing touches on the house. Her mom loved the big kitchen, and she and her younger sister had their own room in the back.  It was in this, her old bedroom, that she was trying to sleep. The crying sound got louder. It didn\u0027t seem like it was outside. It sounded like it was coming from the other side of the bed. When she turned and looked, she saw her younger sister. She still looked five years old. The old woman couldn\u0027t remember her any other way, as she had died from a sickness at age five.  \\\"What\u0027s wrong?\\\" she asked her sister. \\\"I miss you. I am so lonely,\\\" answered the little girl, who was so thin you could see through her. The old lady closed her eyes and reached for her sister. That is how they found her the next day, holding her pillow and smiling.  \\\"She died in her sleep.\\\" \\\"It is best that way.\\\""

It\u0027s gross and a waste of time!\\\" In response, Joey\u0027s mom told him that in order for him to grow up and be big and strong like she is, he must brush his teeth. In disgust, with his mom watching to make sure he brushed his teeth right, he brushed his teeth and whined until he was finished. The next day, Joey did not brush his teeth and told his mom that he did. After going to school, one of Joey\u0027s friends said that his breath stunk and began to make fun of him. This made Joey very angry, so he pushed the boy over and started to cry. A teacher came over and called the principal as both kids were being loud and starting a fight. Joey\u0027s mom came to school and took him home. After asking what was wrong, Joey told his mom that he didn\u0027t brush his teeth. After hearing this, his mom marched him up to the bathroom and forced him to brush his teeth. \\\"You won\u0027t get teased if you brush your teeth, Joey!\\\" she yelled, and then left the room. From that day forward, Joey brushed his teeth every day so the other kids wouldn\u0027t make fun of him."

Snowball then jumped to the table next to the couch. Then, she jumped to the middle shelf.  \\\"That\u0027s dangerous!\\\" said Fuzzy. Snowball and Fuzzy were still small kittens.

        "text": "The best afternoon I ever had with my grandfather was when we went down to the river and fished.  It was a hot July day, and I was bored. My grandfather was sitting in the backyard, reading. \\\"Hey, you look like you need some fun,\\\" he said.  \\\"Want to go fishing?\\\" I said sure, and he went to the garage.  He came out with two poles, some hooks, and some fishing line. Everything was in pieces, but he showed me how to put it all together.  I asked if we needed worms, and he said no. Then, we set off to the river.  It was only about ten blocks to the river, but walking along past the library and the store, he told me about how he used to go fishing with his friend Steve. They used to catch catfish, then take them home so that their mothers could cook them for dinner.  When we got to the park at the river, my grandfather went right to the bank, then turned and walked up along the side of the river until we were off in the shade under the trees right at the edge of the park. There, he taught me how to throw my line in the water. Then we sat down to wait. While we were fishing, my grandfather told me lots of stories about what he and Steve did as kids. We didn\u0027t have any worms, so we never caught any fish, but sitting there as he told me stories made it a great afternoon."

Billy loved Tumble and would visit him outside when he got home from school. Tumble\u0027s favorite food was oatmeal.  So, every day after school, Billy would make Tumble a big bowl of oatmeal and take it outside for Tumble to enjoy.  Tumble would see Billy and walk up to him as fast as a turtle can go.  Billy would put the bowl down and wait for Tumble to come up to the bowl to eat from it. When Tumble reached the bowl, he put his nose on it.  But, the oatmeal was too hot to eat.  Billy reached down and blew on the hot oatmeal, to cool it down for Tumble to eat.  Once the oatmeal was cool enough, Tumble could dig in and eat his big bowl of oatmeal.  Billy loved to watch as Tumble ate his bowl of oatmeal, because Billy took good care of Tumble, everyday."

They changed into their bathing suits and went to the water.  The water was very cold.  They chose not swim and walked to the sand.  Then they laid down on some towels and enjoyed the sun.  After several hours Jenny and her friends fell asleep.  They woke up and the sun was beginning to set.  When Jenny sat up she found that it was painful to touch her skin. When she looked down she saw that she had a very bad sunburn.  Her friends were also very badly sunburned so they went home.  Jenny\u0027s mother gave her a cream to put on the sunburn.

Billy and Sandy had even heard that sometimes Bob the clown would give out free cotton candy and candy apples. They had waited all year and were so excited. They did all their chores and cleaned their rooms so they could go to the fair. When they got to the fair they were so happy to see that Bob the clown was handing out cotton candy and candy apples. Billy and Sandy waited in line and then once it was their turn Billy got a balloon in the shape of a dog and Sandy got a big bag of cotton candy.

One day he went out with his dog to go check on the farm. There they found a wild duck, a cat, and a pumpkin. Gob started to chase the duck. The duck flew away. Gob started to get hungry. Gob then ate the pumpkin. Bob got mad at Gob for eating the pumpkin. Bob then threw Gob into the house. Bob then grabbed a bucket. He started to collect as many potatoes as he could find. Bob loved potatoes. He collected around 600 potatoes! Bob started to run out of room for all the potatoes he found. He then started to eat as many as he could. In 1 hour he ate 100 potatoes! He got so full he took a nap. When he awoke he found the cat eating all the potatoes! The cat ate 200 potatoes before Bob awoke. However, Bob was too full and fat to move. The cat laughed and wanted to eat the potatoes again. Just then, Gob comes running out to chase the cat away! The cat was too fat to run away. It had eaten too many potatoes! Gob grabbed the cat with his teeth and tossed the cat down a well. Gob became a hero for saving the potatoes! Bob now lets Gob eat whatever he wants, including pumpkins! Gob is a very happy dog now!"

She put some corn out for the squirrel to eat, but other bully squirrels came, too. The brown-haired lady started giving the little squirrel peanuts to eat. She gave some to the bully squirrels, too, so they would leave the three-legged squirrel alone.  The winter snow melted and then it was spring. The grass turned green and the air was warm. Now, when the little squirrel with three legs would come to see the brown-haired lady with the peanuts, it would take the peanuts and dig a little hole and hide the peanuts for later. The squirrel would hold the peanut in its mouth and dig and dig and dig, and then it would put the peanut in the hole and pat it down with its little front paw. Then it would run back over to the brown-haired lady and get some more peanuts to eat."

        "text": "Tim Goes To The Beach  Today was exciting. Tim\u0027s mom was taking him and his little sisters, Rebecca and Georgia, to the beach! They were going to go swimming. Then they were also going to have a picnic lunch on the beach. After their picnic lunch, Tim\u0027s mom was going to light a campfire and they were going to eat toasted marshmallows.  Tim and his mom and his two little sisters hopped into the van. His little sisters were both very blonde and pretty little girls. They were only 4 years old. Because they lived in the city, they had a short drive to get to the beach. To pass the time, Tim played Eye Spy with his mother as they drove for a bit. Once they had gotten bored with Eye Spy, they played 20 Questions. Tim would think of something, and his mother would ask him questions to try and guess what it was.  When they got to the beach, it was warm, and sunny. The salt water was warm, and the waves lapped up on the shore. It made a lovely noise. It also felt great on Tim\u0027s toes, and his little sisters giggled when the waves hit them.  When they had had their fill of swimming, Tim\u0027s mom had them sit down to a nice dinner. They ate and ate. They ate macaroni salad. Then they ate some cold chicken. They also had lemon pie for dessert.  Tim\u0027s mom started a fire, and they spent the rest of the evening as the sun set eating toasted marshmallows and singing campfire songs. Tim thought it was a very good day."

        "text": "Joey got a German Shepherd for his birthday present. He had never had any pets before, but was always excited to see the other dogs and cats in his neighborhood. Since his birthday was in June, he spent a lot of time playing outside with his new puppy, which he named Max. Max and Joey would often run through fields in a game of chase. They also liked to go through the small forest behind the house, making a game of hide and seek. They never went near the lake because Joey was afraid of water. One day, Max hid a little too well and Joey couldn\u0027t find him. Joey spent the afternoon looking for his German Shepherd where they often played, like the field and forest. Joey was a shy boy who often read by himself, and Max was his best friend.  After dinner, he went to look for Max one last time before he had to take a bath and go to bed. He heard some barking on the next street, so he ran to see if it was his puppy. Sure enough, he saw Max playing with a poodle. The dogs were having so much fun. Joey brought Max home, happy that he had his puppy back. Max seemed to be happy to have his human by his side as well as a new doggy friend. All summer long, Joey took Max to the poodle\u0027s house so they could play without having to worry about losing his present."

After they had heated up the oven, they put the chicken and the pan on the center oven rack and set the timer.  Then, as they peeled potatoes and carrots to go with the chicken, Amy, Joe and Cindy talked about dinner.  Amy said, \\\"Joe, this is too much food for you, me and little Cindy to eat in one night. We\u0027ll have leftovers.  What can we do with the leftover chicken?\\\"  Joe said, \\\"We could make chicken sandwiches or chicken and rice.\\\"  Amy said, \\\"How about chicken soup?\\\"  Cindy said, \\\"I like chicken with Thai noodles with red peppers.  We haven\u0027t made those in a long time.\\\"   \\\"That sounds good,\\\" said Amy.  \\\"We\u0027ll make that for dinner tomorrow.\\\"  \\\"Yum!\\\" said Joe.  \\\"That\u0027s a great idea.

I\u0027ll do the dishes and put away the leftovers.\\\"  Soon, Cindy went into the kitchen to get a glass of water.  Joe was eating the chicken.

        "text": "A dancer named Eliza was part of the New York Ballet Performance and Arts Company. She spent all hours of the day practicing for her recital. Eliza had difficulties doing both her schoolwork and her dancing; she often fell behind in math. Her best friend Maddy was also a dancer; they often competed with each other to get the top parts in the dances. Their moms thought that because they competed with each other they might become mean towards one another but they did not let that get in the way of their friendship.  In their latest recital Eliza had got the top part in the dance called \\\"The Beauty and the Rain\\\". The hours were long and draining on their bodies. All the girls and boys who left the performance center looked so tired. They couldn\u0027t pick up their practice bags off of the floor as they walked to their parents to go home and their eyelids were droopy. When Eliza got home, the last thing on her mind was her math problems. All she could think of was bathing her sore feet and her head hitting her soft fluffy pillow.  Her teachers started to become aware of Eliza\u0027s problems in the classroom and called her parents into school to talk to her teachers. Her parents knew that dancing was Eliza\u0027s dream and would not let anything get in the way of her performances. It was important for her parents for Eliza to do well in all parts of her life, but her dancing is what lit a fire in her eyes. Her parents got her extra help to help with her homework, which helped Eliza keep track of all parts of her life."

He didn\u0027t even have to practice that much. He remembered that he once hit the ball so hard that it flew out of the park. Home run!  He was also a fan of basketball. He enjoyed watching people on television pull off crazy tricks like slam dunking (but he didn\u0027t really like all of the passes). He wasn\u0027t quite that good yet, but he was pretty good at making shots from the three point line. He knew that if he kept practicing, he would be really great someday.  Finally, he loved football. Unlike baseball and basketball, he didn\u0027t play football himself, but he was drawn to the games. He got a kick out of sitting in the stands, cheering on his team and friends. He once cheered so loud that he could barely speak at all for the rest of the day."

        "text": "Mary loved walking through the woods with her dog, Max.  Max and Mary would go on all sorts of adventures together.  They really loved looking for blueberries together and then falling asleep next to each other in the tall grass.  One day, as Mary was picking the blueberries, she turned around to find that Max was not there.  She became worried and ran off to look for her dog.    She looked in all of their favorite spots...next to the stream, in their secret hiding place behind the raspberry bushes, and even inside the old cabin that sat in the woods.  But poor Max was nowhere to be found.  Nonetheless, Mary would not give up.   She kept looking and she found him not very far away.  He had seen a squirrel and run to chase it.  When Mary called Max\u0027s name he left the squirrel and happily returned to Mary, wagging his tail as he went."
