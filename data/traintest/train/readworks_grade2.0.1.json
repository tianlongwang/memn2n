But cars did not always have seat belts. If a car stops suddenly, people are pushed forward in their seats. In the days before seat belts, more people were thrown out of cars in accidents. People started demanding that car companies do something to protect drivers and passengers. Companies began to develop seat belts. But designing the belts to work well was not a smooth process. The first seat belts only went across a person's waist. These belts attached to the base of the seat in the car. These new belts held people in their seats. However, many people were still hurt in crashes. New types of seat belts were tried. The best new ones went across a person's chest and waist. These belts keep a person's whole body from moving around. As a result, fewer people get hurt in car accidents. Although seat belts helped keep people safe, some people did not want to wear them. Later on, states passed laws that said people must wear seat belts. Today, all cars come with seat belts. Using seat belts makes everyone safer.

He kicked at the ground with his foot, twisted his body around, and looked up at his mother with tears in his eyes. Billy was angry. His mother was a nurse, and she had a new job at a senior center. \"Old-folks home,\" Billy called it. \"Senior Center,\" his mother corrected. Billy didn't like the seniors. He didn't like the senior center. He thought it was boring. Billy's mother wanted Billy to come to the senior center every day after school. Billy wanted to go to see his friends or play video games at home. Billy's mother wouldn't let him. \"I don't have a babysitter for you,\" she said. \"And you can't go to a friend's house unsupervised every day.\" The senior center was across the street from Billy's school. \"Come meet me at the center at 3pm,\" his mother directed. \"You can stay here until my shift ends at 4:30.\" So it was decided. Every day after school Billy said good-bye to his friends and walked over to the senior center. \"Hello, Billy. How was school today?\" asked Curtis, when Billy came in. Curtis was the building's security guard. \"Hello. Curtis. School was okay,\" Billy said. Every day at the senior center started like that. Billy would then go to the nurse's station where there was a quiet room. He would do his homework, then sit and stare at the walls. Billy would try to look as bored and as miserable as possible, in the hope someone would notice and convince his mother to let him go home. He would sit and think of his friends, home playing video games. He thought ofthe worlds he could be creating and the monsters he could be slaying. If only he were playing video games, too. Billy's mother didn't appreciate any of this. \"You're being ridiculous,\" she said. \"Why are you acting this way? The senior center isn't torture. There's a lot you could do here. I don't understand why you're being so dramatic,\" said Billy's mother, exasperated. \"Why don't you help me or Curtis?\" \"No, thanks,\" said Billy, who would go right back to looking miserable. After a few days of this routine Billy did start to get bored. His plan wasn't working. His mother wasn't giving in. Billy was going to have to get to like the senior center. The next day after school Billy went to the senior center. He said hello to Curtis and went to the nurse's station. He did his homework. This time, for a change, when Billy finished his homework, he decided to go exploring. Billy left the nurse's station and turned right down the hallway. He had never seen the rest of the facility. The building was huge. Every hallway looked the same. Billy followed the hallway until it came to another hallway. After a while, Billy was lost. Billy sat down in the hallway and tried to remember the way back. He didn't want to ask directions. He wasn't supposed to be there. He didn't want to get in trouble. So he sat and tried to remember the way out. He heard something coming from the door nearest him. \"Oh, for goodness' sake, Henry,\" said a woman. \"You don't look anything like a Knight of the Realm. You look more like an elephant.\" \"An elephant! Ifl look like an elephant, you look like a peacock,\" a man's voice replied. \"They must be residents,\" thought Billy. Curious, he crawled over and peeked inside the room. He saw something he had not expected. The woman who was speaking had on a pink track suit and an even pinker feather boa around her shoulders. The man she was speaking to was sitting in a wheel chair, holding a shield and sword, and wearing a helmet. The shield, sword, and helmet were made of paper and glue. They had begun to droop a little. Billy supposed this was why he looked like an elephant. Billy was starting to laugh when he saw the woman in pink looking at him. \"Well, don'tjust sit there spying. Come on in,\" said another man. This man was speaking to Billy. He walked in. \"Who are you?\" they asked. Billy explained that he was waiting for his mother, the nurse. The seniors introduced themselves. The woman in pink was named Mildred. The man with the shield was Harold. \"Pleased to meet you,\" said Billy. He asked them what they were doing. \"We're rehearsing for the talent show,\" said Mildred. \"You have a talent show here?\" asked Billy. \"Of course,\" said Mildred. \"We're the Senior Center Dramatic Society. We always perform in the talent show, and we rehearse even when there isn't a show coming up. Sometimes we make up our own plays.\" \"It's important to be creative,\" said Harold. \"It keeps you young.\" \"Would you like to help us?\" asked Mildred. \"We need an impartial critic.\" \"My mother told me I'm dramatic,\" said Billy. \"Great,\" said Mildred. \"You'll fit right in.\" Billy agreed to help. He helped them read their lines and fix their costumes. Afterwards, they took Billy back to the nurse's station where his mother was waiting. \"Did you have fun?\" his mother asked Billy. \"Yes, I did,\" Billy answered. From that day on Billy spent his afternoons at the center with the Dramatic Society. The seniors weren't boring at all.

Because he was five years old, he thought this was awesome. \"Hello, lionl\" he yelled. The lion, a female with a patchy coat, opened one eye and stared at him lazily. Then she turned over and fell back asleep. James considered petting the lion or scratching its belly ,  Trixie, his old cat, loyed belly scratches ,  but he was proud enough of his new pet that he wanted to tell his parents first. He jumped out of bed and walked into the kitchen. His father was eating breakfast. \"Do you want me to strip the bathroom moldings this weekend?\" his father asked his mother. \"Or can it wait a week?\" \"It can wait,\" she said, frowning. \"But you should really want to strip the moldings.\" \"I got a lion!\" yelled James. \"That's nice, dear,\" said his mother. \"Well played, son,\" said his father. \"Most ?ve-year-olds go with something showier, like an ocelot or a puma. But you'ye gone the classic route.\" ?'ll \"Sure,\" his father said, \"everyone wants to ride their lion to school. But where will you park it?\" \"Bill,\" his mother said. 'We'ye talked about your sarcasm.\" \"It's not sarcasm,\" his father said. \"I'm being funn, \" James's father didn't get to finish his sentence. It was interrupted by an ea r-splitting roar, coming from James's bedroom. For a few seconds, neither one of his parents said anything. \"Maybe I'll name her Tiger,\" said James. \"To confuse people.\" \"James,\" said his father quietly. \"What was that?\" \"Oh dear me,\" said his mother, crossing herself. James's father craned his head to peer down the hall towards James's bedroom. After a moment, he knelt down in front of his son and put his hands on his shoulders. \"James,\" he said. \"I need you to be completely, 100% honest with me. No make-believe, no story-time? Can you do that?\" James nodded. \"Sure I can.\" He noticed a droplet of sweat dripping down his father's forehead. \"O.l., great,\" said his father, in a strange, small yoice. \"James, is there a |ion...a real |ion...in your bedroom?\" \"Dad,\" said James, patiently. \"We've been oyer this.\" His father stared at him. James sighed. \"Of course there is, Dad.\" \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\" his mother screamed. \"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!\" \"Helen, stop it!\" snapped his father. His father stood up. \"This is ridiculous. I don't know what that noise was, but there is not a lion in your bedroom, James.\" James's father walked angrily to the broom closet. He opened the door, pulled out a mop with a long wooden handle, and began marching towards the hallway. \"For gosh sake, Bill,\" his mother said, grabbing him by the shoulder. \"Let's just get out of here and call the police. Or animal control. Or someone. Please.\" \"And tell them what?\" His father wheeled around to face her. \"What? That we have a lion in the house? Oh, I'm sure they'll send a car right out.\" \"Tell them her name is Trixie ll,\" said James. \"Someone might have met her before.\" \"Bill...\" \"I'm not calling anyone,\" his father said. With that, he turned and stomped down the hallway. James and his mother looked down after him. \"Quiet,\" his mother hissed. They watched his father approach the door. He reached for the handle and, holding the mop high in his other hand, gently swung the door open and poked his head around the corner. James barely had time to be curious about his father's reaction before his father turned on his heels, slammed the door shut, and went sprinting down the hallway towards James and his mother. \"Get out of the house right now!\" his father hollered as he ran. \"Go! Run! Now! Move! Move! Move!\" His father practically shoved James and his mother through the living room and out the front door. When they were outside, his father doubled over, panting for breath. \"Where in the world did you get a !!on?\" he yelled at James. \"You mean it's reef?\" his mother screamed, her eyes bugging. \"Ahhhhhhhhhh!\" \"They come from Africa, right?\" said James. By this time, neighbors had heard the commotion and begun gathering. Their next-door neighbors were the Horowitzes. Mr. Horowitz walked up to James's father. \"Bill, is something the matter?\" James's father turned and stared at Mr. Horowitz. \"There's a lion in my son's bedroom.\" Mr. Horowitz threw a quick, worried glance at his wife, who was standing on their front lawn. His wife shrugged. \"0.|.,\" said Mr. Horowitz, slowly. \"Do you want us to call somebody?\" \"Her name is Trixie ll,\" explained James. \"Or maybe Ms. Botticelli. I like how that name sounds\" \"Call somebody!\" his father yelled. \"Call anybody! There's a lion in my son's bedroom.\" By this time a dozen neighbors had gathered in front of James's house. All of them were yelling at each other, trying to figure out what had happened, when suddenly everyone froze. There, at the front door of James's house, was the massive African lion. Everyone stared at her, completely silent. For a few moments, the lion stared back. Finally, she let out a long sigh. \"Guys,\" the lion said, \"I know I'm a guest and I don't mean to be a pain, but I had a really late night last night and l have a client meeting at 10:00, so I was really hoping to sleep in. Do you think you guys could keep it down just a little bit? Thanks.\" And with that, the lion turned and walked back in the house. \"What about Rambo?\" said James. \"That's a cool name. Rambo.

Some engineers develop new medicines or find better ways to keep foods fresh and safe. Engineers start by identifying a problem to solve or a new product to design. They search for ways to fix the problem or make the product. They look at different ideas and choose the best one. Often, engineers make a model and test it. They look for ways to improve what they have made. Sandra Cruz-Pol is an engineer. She also teaches engineering students at a college.

The spinning blades turned a pole inside the tower. The pole then ran a water pump or moved a stone that ground, or mashed, grain into little pieces. Today, people have learned how to get much more power from the wind. We have made a lot of progress! Now we have wind turbines. These turbines are modern windmills. Wind turbines have large blades at the top of a high pole. The blades spin quickly when the wind blows. When the blades spin, they power a generator. That is a machine that makes electricity.

When they get to the zoo, he sees all kinds of animals. There are chickens and lambs. There is a goat and a cow. Jared puts a nickel in a dispenser. A big handful of animal pellets come out. They smell like dirty socks. He holds the pellets up to a goat, and the goat grabs them with his tongue. The tongue is soft and it tickles Jared's hand.\"Ah!\"Jared yells and jumps back from the goat.\"Bleeeeeeet says the goat. He wants more food. Jared doesn't have any more food to give him. He keeps walking backward until he feels something fluffy against the back of his legs. A whole flock of sheep are standing together.\"Baaaaaaah!\"they say. They are looking for food from Jared, too. One of the sheep is a little different from the others. It's a black sheep. Jared walks up to the funny animal. Suddenly, the sheep's face turns pink. \"Why do you have a pink face?\" he asks the sheep. \"Why do you have a brown face?\" the sheep asks. \"Because that's the color of my skin!\" Jared says. Suddenly, he realizes the sheep is talking. \"Hey! You can talk!\" \"Only you can hear me,\" says the sheep. \"And only you can see my true color.\" At this, the whole sheep magically turns bright pink. \"Let me introduce myself. I am Gael, the sacred pink sheep. | live in shame.\" \"Why are you ashamed? You are beautiful!\" \"I cannot show my true self to the other sheep,\" he says. \"Why not?\" \"They won't accept me with my pink face,\" says Gael. Jared couldn't believe this. The other sheep seemed nice, just hungry. He takes a nickel from his pocket. He gets more smelly treats and walks over to the other sheep. \"Little boy, have you brought us food?\" asks the biggest sheep. \"I have,\" says Jared. \"But first, I have a question.\" \"You can address it to me,\" says the biggest sheep. \"I am the leader, Conrad.\" \"Conrad, are any of you...pink?\" All the sheep begin to laugh. \"Clearly we are not pink, silly boy,\" says Conrad. \"You can see our colors.\" \"What if one of your sheep was secretly pink?\" \"Secretly pink? We would never accept him! He would be a black sheep,\" Conrad says, laughing at his own joke. Gael, the pink sheep, is standing alone on the other side of the petting zoo.

Perfect hiking weather, he thought. Daniel loved his backyard. There were plenty of tall trees. If he walked far enough, he would reach a creek. When it was really warm outside, he could walk in the water to cool off. The water was always cold. The leaves were just beginning to grow on the trees after the cold winter. Daniel wandered for a bit. He picked up a long stick and used it to clear a way through the forest. Suddenly, Daniel saw something in the distance that wasn't a rock or a leaf. When he got closer, he knelt down to investigate. He found a small injured bird between the fallen leaves. He looked around and saw a bird's nest sitting on a branch. He carefully climbed up the trunk of the tree with the nest to get a closer look. The nest was empty, and he didn't see any birds around. Then, he ran back to his house. \"Mom, I found a bird that's hurt!\" he told her as he ran through the door. She looked for a shoebox, and then she said, \"Well, let's go have a look.\" Daniel led his mom back to the injured bird. His mom knelt down and looked carefully at it. \"Let's try to save it!\" she said. She gently picked up the bird and put it in the shoebox. Then she said, \"We can take it to the animal hospital in town.\" They took the bird to the animal hospital. After a few days, the vet visited Daniel's house with the bird. It was healed. Daniel and his mom could hear the bird chirping when they opened the door. The vet said, \"The bird is ready to go back to its home in the trees.\" Daniel was so excited.

Akers \"Come on, Angie. It's time to go.\" \"I'm not going,\" said Angela. \"Please,\" said her father. \"We're going to be late.\" \"Good. I hope we are late. I hope we're a million years late, and by the time we get to the music school, piano doesn't even exist anymore. The people of the future will be smart. They'll understand that mankind is better off without the piano. They'll understand me.\" \"Okay, sweetheart. That's great. Please get in the car.\" \"No. On no account. This is America, Dad. Didn't you hear? Nobody can make anybody play piano against her will. It's called democracy.\" \"Angela? If you don't get in that car right now, your mother is going to be very angry at me. And if she's angry at me, I'm going to forbid you from using the computer.\" \"For how long?\" \"Until Christmas.\" Dad wasn't joking. Angela got in the car. As they drove, beads of sweat formed on the back of her neck, and her stomach started to feel like she had just swallowed a hockey puck. Practicing piano scared her to death. Her teacher, Mr. Poliakoff, was a hairy old man who talked with a lisp that made him nearly impossible to understand. She could never tell if he was saying, \"I see,\" or calling for a \"high C.\" Uncertainty made Angela nervous, and nerves made it impossible for her to play. Not that Angela wanted to play anyway. She thought that there was no music on Earth more boring than Mr. Poliakoff's sheet music. For three months, she had gone once a week to learn famous compositions like \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,\" \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat,\" and \"Three Blind Mice.\" As boring as those songs were, they were apparently impossible to play. Each time Angela picked up her fingers she was seized by fear. What if she played the wrong note? Would Mr. Poliakoff shout at her? Or, worse, would he simply shake his head in disappointment? \"Fear is the enemy of success,\" he would tell her, except that when he said it, it sounded more like \"sushshesh.\" But when it came to the piano, fear was all Angela had. \"Timbuktu,\" she said. Her dad looked away from the road to give her a funny look. She went on. \"Antarctica. The Yukon. Kazakhstan. Borneo. Tasmania.\" \"Yes?\" asked her father, finally. \"I'm trying to think of places I'd like less than piano class.\" \"Did you come up with anything?\" \"Nope. Even the middle of the Amazon rainforest would be more fun.\" \"Well, I'm glad you've been studying your geography, at least.\" When her father looked away, Angela stuck out her tongue. That would show him. As usual, Mr. Poliakoff's music school smelled like cabbage. Angela did not know where he might be cooking the foul vegetable, but she was certain she didn't want to find out. She trudged down the darkened hallway like her feet were made of rocks, glad her father wasn't there to tell her she was going to be late. \"Not that he cares anyway,\" she thought. \"He's done his job, dropping me off at the building. He doesn't even care if I actually make it to class.\" Angela's eyes went wide. She had an idea. She pressed her back against the wall and slinked away from Mr. Poliakoff's classroom. She would have to spend an hour in the music school, but that didn't mean she had to learn any music. She tip-toed down the dark corridor, fearful that her piano teacher might burst out at any moment and bellow, \"You! Come here and practice 'Ring Around the Rosie!'\" But the door did not open. Mr. Poliakoff did not catch her. Angela was free. She was sneaking her way to the front door of the music school, planning on passing the hour in the sun, beneath a tree or on a bench, when she heard a funny sound. It sounded like someone playing the piano, scales, but it sounded different than what she was used to. It sounded like the person playing was having fun. She followed the sound. It was coming from one of the classrooms. She peered through the glass window and saw that the piano bench was empty. Feeling sneaky, she turned the handle and padded into the empty classroom. The music was coming from a computer in the corner. She walked towards it, dying to find out what it was, when she learned the room wasn't as empty as she had thought. \"Hello?\" said a voice that stopped Angela's heart. It came from a woman with long, gray hair and a mouth that twisted up a little bit at the sides. \"Can I help you?\" \"No,\" stammered Angela. \"I, uh, Ijust heard the music, and, \" \"Do you like the piano?\" \"I hate the piano,\" said Angela. The woman started to laugh. \"Well!\" she said. \"That's too bad for you, since you're in a music school.\" \"No kidding.\" \"I'm Mrs. O'Hara.\" \"That's nice. I should be going.\" \"Hold on, hold on. You wanted to know about this music?\" Angela was silent. \"Come on. It's okay to be curious. Do you know anything about jazz?\" \"No.\" \"Well, here it is.\" She turned up the volume. The man playing piano tapped at the keys like a baby hitting something with a hammer. He sang like a clown, making strange noises and putting on all sorts of funny voices. The words he sang were even stranger: All that meat and no potatoes All that food to the alligators, yes. Hold me steady. I am ready For all that meat and no potatoes. \"It sounds so silly!\" \"Well, that's Fats,\" said Mrs. O'Hara. \"Who's Fats?\" \"Fats Waller. The piano player. He's the one who wrote the song.\" \"A grown-up wrote this song?\" \"A very talented grown-up. Don't think about the silly words. Listen to the piano. What does it sound like?\" \"It sounds crazy.\" \"It's all over the place, isn't it?\" Mrs. O'Hara was right. None of his notes were where Angela was taught they were supposed to be. He played fast when he should have played slowly; he played slowly when he should have played fast. In between lines, he would shout nonsense like, \"Oh, stop it, Thomas! You're tickling early!\" Crazy was the only word for it. \"Who's Thomas?\" asked Angela. \"I don't know.\" \"Huh. Well, I guess I should get going.\" \"You're supposed to be in class, aren't you? With Mr. Poliakoff?\" Angela made a face. \"You're going to make me go back to class, aren't you?\" \"I'm going to make you learn a little piano,\" said Mrs. O'Hara. \"Because that's what your parents paid for.\" \"Can I play a song like this?\" \"Not quite yet. Fats Waller spent a lot of time learning to play normal piano before he could start playing it crazy.\" \"He played 'Ring Around the Rosie?'\" \"And 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,' and 'Three Blind Mice,' and all of Mr. Poliakoff's favorites.\" \"But ifI learn to play those...eventually I can play this?\" \"You got it,\" said Mrs. O'Hara, as she sat down beside the bench. Angela put her fingers on the keys and prepared to play. Her fingers weren't afraid any more. ", "metadata": "Grade: 2 Lexile: 560L", "author": "W.M.

Silver and Fry were both trying to develop extra-strong glue. But the glue they produced was weak. It did not seem useful at all. One day, Fry had an idea. He put the glue on a piece of paper and used the paper as a bookmark. Fry saw that this bookmark would stay on a page. He could remove it and stick it onto another page. The paper did not fall off. Researchers worked to improve the glue. They made sure the glue stayed on the piece of paper and not on the page. In 1980, the company named the product Post-it Notes.

Stacey's mother never complained about this. But Stacey could tell it bothered her. Anyone would be bothered if they had to work all day on such an ugly computer. And so, one day while her mother was taking a bath, Stacey decided to help.  She was going to make her mother's computer beautiful Mommy's gonna love it,\" she said to herself as she got to work. The first problem was the color. Grey simply would not do. If Stacey were allowed to have a computer, she would want it to be pink. But Mommy's favorite color was purple. So Stacey got out her purple marker and started coloring. As the marker dragged across the plastic computer, it made a squinch squinch squinch noise. Stacey did not like the sound. But she loved the way it looked. \"Much better!\" she said as she finished. \"Now we need some sparkle.\" Stacey took out a bottle of glue and spread big globs of it on the computer's shell. She tipped whole handfuls of glitter, blue, pink, and red, all over. Most of it stuck, and she only got a little glue in her hair. \"This looks almost perfect,\" said Stacey. \"But what's missing?\" It only took her a moment to guess the answer. \"Stickers!\" Stacey's mom liked to wear hats. And Stacey had lots of stickers of hats. She had pink hats, blue hats, and orange ones. She had fedoras and top hats and cowboy hats and even a funny hat called a \"porkpie hat.\" She put them all over Mommy's computer, right on the screen. She knew it was perfect when there was no part of the computer that wasn't covered in hats, glitter, or purple marker. \"Stacey? What are you doing with my computer?\" Stacey's mom stood in the doorway, wrapped in a bathrobe, her hair dripping wet. \"Look, Mommy! I made it beautiful.\" Stacey's mom screamed as loud as she ever had. She tried to peel off the stickers, but they wouldn't come off. She scraped at the glitter, but it was stuck.

Steamships, powered by steam engines, traveled across the ocean. Their trips took weeks, not months. Today, huge supertankers carry oil across oceans.

She calls this game \"Treasure Hunt.\" When she plays Treasure Hunt, she puts on a tan explorer hat and a jacket with big pockets for collecting things. She is Celia the Brave, the greatest treasure hunter in the world. She digs with the shovel and pours the dirt into the sieve. Then, Celia, the greatest treasure hunter in the world, shakes the sieve all around. She shakes it very gently, up and down, then side to side. Shaking dirt around is one of her favorite things to do. When she does this, all the big rocks stay on top of the sieve. They are too big to fall through the holes. She finds rocks with beautiful stripes and patterns in them. The sun catches the edges of the rocks, and some of them shine like gemstones. The rocks she finds in her yard look different from the rocks she finds at her grandmother's house. She wonders why. For example, one rock she finds in her yard is broken in half, and she can see the inside of it. It has stripes and dots in it. It is grey and white. But the rocks from her grandmother's yard are orange. She asks herself why the rocks are striped with different colors and patterns. She walks into the kitchen. Her father is making dessert. He is a pastry chef at a fancy restaurant. His job is to make sweets all day. \"Are these jewels?\" she asks her father. \"Those are rocks,\" he says. But to her, they are still jewels. \"Why do they have stripes in them?\" Celia asks. \"I think you should do research at the library,\" her father says. \"You always say that!\" says Celia. \"I always say that because it's always a good idea,\" says her father. The next day, Celia puts her favorite rock in her lunchbox and brings it to school. All day, she feels like she has a secret. After school, she goes to see the librarian. She brings her secret rock with her. \"Hello Celia,\" says Mr. Beakman the librarian. \"I'm Celia the Treasure Hunter today,\" Celia explains. She shows him her favorite rock. \"I see,\" says the librarian. \"And I guess you want to know more about it.\" Mr. Beakman takes Celia to the computer. He types in \"Geology.\" Geology is the study of the physical earth, including rocks and minerals. He shows Celia where to find books on geology. But the books are for older, high school students, and there are many words she doesn't know yet. So she just looks at the pictures, instead. Celia sees pictures of fossils and dinosaur bones. In the next picture, a volcano erupts and a layer of lava pours over the dinosaur. That lava dries and traps the bones inside. The next series of photos shows a big piece of ice called a glacier. The glacier melts and runs down over the rocks. It pushes different rocks with it. It makes patterns on the rock called striations. Celia is confused. She understands how the water makes grooves in the top of the rock. But how would this make stripes inside of a rock? She goes home after school and finds her father in the kitchen. She shows him the book. \"Can you help me understand how stripes get inside of a rock?\" she asks. Her father looks at the book and nods. \"Do you see the dessert I'm making?\" he asks. \"It's called tiramisu. Watch how I make it. It might help you understand.\" First, he puts down a layer of tiny cakes called \"lady fingers.\" Celia giggles at the name. Of course, they aren't actually fingers! After he has one layer of cake, he spreads a layer of sugary cheese on top. This is followed by another layer of cake, another layer of delicious sweet cheese, and so on. The tiramisu is in a deep glass bowl, and you can see the layers through the glass. There is one layer of cake, and then there is one layer of cheese; it repeats all the way up to the top. \"It looks like a pattern,\" she says. \"It looks like stripes through the glass.\" \"Well, I'm no geologist,\" says dad. \"I'm just a pastry chef. But I think your rock was made in a similar way to my dessert. One layer at a time.\" He cuts a slice of cake and puts it on a plate. \"Now imagine that instead of cake, these layers were made of different types of rocks.\" \"I understand now!\" says Celia. Then she says, \"Good thing there are no dinosaur bones in my dessert.\" Celia and her father decide to eat some of the lesson. You can't eat rocks, but these layers are delicious!

How does an orange get from the tree to your refrigerator? People who work as fruit pickers move through groves filled with orange trees. When an orange is ripe, the picker clips it off the tree. All picked oranges are then carefully moved to a packing plant. In the plant, oranges are placed on a machine with moving rollers. Special brushes wash the fruit as it rolls along. Next, each orange is dried. Another machine lines up the oranges in boxes. A computer checks each box. Any oranges with spots or damage are removed. Orange growers want to produce good fruit that people will buy. Finally, each orange is given a sticker and placed in a box. Full boxes are shipped in cool trucks to stores. Each storeowner places the oranges on shelves. Then someone from your family comes to the store. Your family member chooses a few oranges, buys them, brings them home, and puts them in your refrigerator. Then, one day, you open your refrigerator, and there those oranges are, ready for you to eat!

She ate it.  \"Mmmm,\" she said. \"Mmmmmm.\"The next piece was a chocolate egg with marshmallow goo inside. She bit into it, and some of the marshmallow got onto her chin. She ate the rest of it. \"Marshmallow goo is the best,\" she said. Next she ate a chocolate shaped like a flower. Then she ate a chocolate shaped like a bunny rabbit. She ate chocolates with raisins inside, and chocolates with pink fluff, and some chocolates that had nothing inside them at all. Finally, she was going to eat all the chocolate she wanted.

He looked mad. \"Hey!\" he said. \"What are you doing with my candy?!\" Keira tried to speak but she was too full. She stood up, and fell back down again. \"Oooooof,\" she groaned. Her face was covered with chocolate. Her hands were sticky. She even had chocolate in her hair. \"I don't feel so good,\" she said. \"I think I ate too much chocolate.\" Tyler started laughing.

They may promise to work to change laws they do not like or to pass new ones. Voters listen to these promises. Then they decide which candidates they think are the best. On Election Day, voters go to a public building, such as a school or a firehouse. They vote by filling out a paper form or, in some places, by using a computer. Long ago, only a small number of people in the United States could vote. Some men were allowed to vote, but women, black people, poor people, and young people could not.

At the end of every Election Day, votes are counted. The winning candidates are announced. Soon, the winners will get their chance to do the things they promised to do.

Suddenly, something hit him in the back of his head. \"Hey, No-Brains!\" someone was shouting. \"Oh no!\" Noah said to Peanuts. \"It's Mitch the bully!\" Mitch was throwing peanuts at Noah. \"Here are some peanuts for your dumb dog!\" Mitch said. That was the last straw!

One day, the sun is very strong, and the temperature is very high. Macy and her mom and dad use their big ears to cool themselves off. They flap their ears back and forth, trying to push away the heat. But it isn't enough\u2014they are still too hot. The family of elephants walks around to look for a way to cool down.

A family of parrots flies by, but all Macy sees is a blur of red, green, and blue. The colorful birds land on a branch nearby, and Macy admires their bright feathers. Then, all of a sudden, Macy spots a loris sleeping on the tree that sits right next to the parrots. Macy gets excited\u2014she never sees lorises because they are only awake at night. The small elephant stops to look at the small, fluffy animal. It has a tiny, round face and big, black eyes. Macy is about to take a step closer when her mom and dad pull her along with their strong trunks, not wanting to wait any longer to cool down. Finally, the three elephants find a big pool of water. They run into it and splash the cool water on each other. Macy feels so much better. She lies down and rolls around. She covers her body in mud. Elephants love to take mud baths. It cools their skin and protects them from bug bites. They all play in the water for a while, and other elephants come to enjoy the mud, too. Then Macy and her parents step out of the water and decide to go and find food. Macy spots a banana tree in the distance. She runs toward the bright yellow fruit.

In order to do that, they needed to buy some art supplies. They needed paint, brushes, and a canvas. Alison liked to plan ahead. She wanted to pick an aisle to meet in, but Molly refused. \"Can't we have an alternate plan?\" Alison begged. \"Just in case?\" \"No way! I have my phone, and you have your phone. Just text me when you get to Circle's. It will be easier that way.\" Alison had to admit, using the phone to find each other did sound like the easier idea at first. But when Alison reached into her backpack to pull out her phone, there was nothing in the pocket but an old piece of gum. Now she was stuck, and not just to the gum! Alison knew Molly had to be somewhere in the store, but where? She sat down to brainstorm. \"If I were a painter, what would I need? What aisle would I go to?\" she asked herself. \"Well, the first thing I would need, I guess, is paint!\" On the first floor of Circle Art Supply was a directory of what items you could find on each floor. Circle was located in New York City, and it was four stories tall. It was easy for someone to get lost inside of it, with the twists and turns of the hallways and stairwells. Alison carefully studied the directory. From the first floor, she could take the stairs to the second. But she couldn't get to the third floor from the second. Instead, she'd have to take an elevator to the fourth, and walk back down a flight of stairs. That meant the third floor was only accessible by the fourth floor. Alison's head started to spin. Paint was on the third floor, but she was on the first. This was going to be confusing! She went upstairs, then back down again. But she got lost! Alison walked down an extra flight of stairs and ended up on the second floor. Then she had to start all over again. When Alison finally got to the third floor, she saw Molly standing in the paint aisle trying to call her. \"Where have you been?\" Molly asked, flustered. \"I have been trying to call your phone for twenty minutes!\" \"Well,\" said Alison, \"I guess you could say I've been walking around in circles.\" ", "metadata": "Grade: 2 Lexile: 580L", "author": "Kyria Abrahams", "id": "254359", "title": "Buying Paint Supplies"}, "questions": [{"text": "Where was Alison supposed to meet Molly?

All these ferocious animals usually steal the spotlight at circuses. Circuses can be a lot of fun. Usually, there are popcorn, lion tamers, clowns, beautiful acrobats, and more. Even elephants walk across the stage with performers on their backs. But even with all the animals, one of the most exciting parts of the circus is the acrobats. Dressed in colorful costumes, these amazing performers fly over the stage on trapezes. Acrobats have to train for many years to do all of these dangerous stunts. It requires a lot of practice. The trapeze is one of the oldest circus acts around. When acrobats first begin to train, they typically start on the trapeze. Then, they can develop new skills. There are many different types of stunts that professional acrobats can do. Sometimes, performers use big pieces of silk that hang from the ceiling to the floor. They use their leg and arm strength to climb the silks. Then they spin, flip, and twirl with the fabric. They have to wrap the silks around their feet or wrists so that they can support their body. It is a big feat! Acrobats also perform on the lyra, or aerial hoop. A rope hangs a big hoop, like a hula hoop, from the ceiling. Acrobats hang off the hoop to do different tricks. They can flip around the hoop, or climb around it using only their legs or arms. This stunt also requires a lot of body strength. Sometimes, two acrobats use just one hoop at the same time to perform. This is a very hard trick! Some circuses only have acrobats. In New York City, there is one group called Lady Circus. These women are professional acrobats and have been training for years. They put on shows every month that always have a big audience. The acrobats wear very colorful costumes they make themselves. People love their performances! Since Lady Circus is loved so much, the acrobats often perform at other events around the city. But whenever they do perform, they always need high ceilings. They have to hang up their trapezes, silks, and hoops. Even though it is a lot of work, the members of Lady Circus love what they do. Not many other people can say that they fly over a stage on a regular basis!

Sometimes the earth shakes beneath people's feet. That shaking is called an earthquake. An earthquake can happen on land or in the ocean. Earthquakes can rattle walls, cause giant waves, and even bring down buildings. Here is why earthquakes happen. Earth is not one solid rock. If you could drill deep into our planet, you would find four layers. The top layer is the crust. Below the crust is the mantle. Under that is the outer core. The deepest layer of Earth is the inner core. The crust and the upper mantle are broken into giant pieces of rocks called tectonic plates. These plates float on top of the mantle like icebergs floating on the ocean. The plates move so slowly, however, that people cannot feel them moving. The plates sometimes move apart or slide past each other. One plate can even sink beneath another. But occasionally the edges of the plates get stuck. When that happens, pressure builds. Eventually, the pressure releases enough energy for the plates to break loose. A relatively small amount of energy is usually required for the plates to break loose, and the nearby ground shakesjust a little. Sometimes, however, a lot of energy is needed.

The water mixes with the salt and minerals. Then it flows into the oceans. Scientists have discovered two other sources of salty ocean water. Some salt comes from underwater volcanoes. Other salt spurts from heated vents on the ocean floor. Most ocean salt, however, starts on land. Lakes are large bodies of water. They are surrounded by land. Lakes usually have fresh water, but some lakes have salt water. The Great Salt Lake in Utah is a saltwater lake. Lake water does not move from place to place. Rivers are filled with freshwater that moves from one place to another. The water in rivers comes mostly from rain. Rivers usually flow into oceans. Streams and creeks are also bodies of moving fresh water. They are smaller than rivers. Streams and creeks can come together and form larger streams or rivers.

People still wanted to improve the tooth cleaner, however. Animal hairs did not feel great against human teeth! Finally, man-made bristles were created. They were made out of nylon. Then plastic was used for handles. Now toothbrushes could be made quickly and cheaply. Millions were sold. About fifty years ago, the electric toothbrush was invented. It does a great job of cleaning teeth. Today, we have toothbrushes with soft or hard bristles. There are special sizes for adults, children, and babies. The toothbrush has come a long way since chew sticks. Who knows what kind of toothbrush will be invented in the future?

Her mom is in the backyard cutting the grass with a lawn mower. The lawn mower is loud, and Clara wishes her mom would play with her instead. But her mom says because it's been sunny and then rainy and then sunny again, the grass has had everything it needs to grow. Now it is very long and has to be cut. Suddenly, the lawn mower turns off. Clara's mom looks upset. Clara wonders what is wrong. Her mom bends over and picks something up out of the grass, and walks over to the porch. Clara's mom has a turtle in her hand! The turtle is small, and as Clara looks closer, she sees that one leg is at an odd angle. \"I think I broke its leg,\" Clara's mom says. \"I'm really very sorry. Will you help me nurse it back to health?\" Clara feels bad for the little turtle. Turtles move slowly, so it probably could not run away when it saw the lawn mower coming. And Clara's mom could not see the turtle in the long grass! It was a mistake, but Clara and her mom will make it right. Clara names the turtle Phillip. Clara and her mom take Phillip the turtle to the veterinarian. The vet takes an x- ray of Phillip's leg, and confirms that it is broken. Phillip the turtle gets a little splint and bandage for his broken leg. The vet tells Clara that Phillip needs plants to eat and water to drink, plus a place to live. Clara and her mom buy a small tank at the pet store on the way home for the turtle to recuperate in. At home, Clara takes good care of Phillip the turtle. She puts water and rocks in the tank. She brings him fruit and leaves to eat, and keeps his water bowl clean. Phillip seems to be in a better mood. After eight weeks, Clara and her mom take Phillip back to the vet, who says that his leg is healed. Clara is both happy and sad. Happy because Phillip is better, but sad because she has to let him go now. When Clara gets home, she kisses Phillip's shell, says goodbye, and lets him go in the backyard. Clara will always remember Phillip.

Long ago, however, cameras had not been invented yet. How did people back then record important moments? Some people told stories about old times. Others wrote down what they remembered. Some people made special drawings to help them recall important moments. Among those people were Native Americans of the Lakota tribe. Every year, Lakota leaders decided which event was most important. A Lakota artist was then asked to draw a special picture of that event. Because each year's picture was decided on during the winter, the drawings became known as winter counts. For a long time, winter counts were drawn on animal skins. Later, the drawings were done on paper. The pictures told the history of the tribe. Each year, the newest winter count was added to the Lakota collection of pictures from earlier times.

We should make a spaceship.\" \"Hey! It's my box, too!\" said little sister Lydia. \"Just because I'm only six doesn't mean I don't get a vote!\" Everyone stared at Lydia. They waited. What would her vote be? \"Well, vote then!\" \"I vote...\" she paused. \"I vote...\" \"Come on, Lydia!\" Everyone was getting impatient. Lydia stared at the ceiling. She got nervous when people stared at her. Finally, she made up her mind. \"I vote...to make a bus!\" she said. When Michael and Lainey heard this, they changed their minds. \"Yeah, we want a bus too!\" Now they had three votes for a bus but only one vote for a spaceship. The bus had the majority vote. \"Fine. How should we make this bus, smarty pants?\" asked Kaitlyn. \"We could cut holes in the box for windows,\" said Michael. \"I'm not allowed to use sharp scissors by myself,\" said Kaitlyn. \"We could use stickers,\" said Lydia. \"Where would we get enough stickers from?\" Kaitlyn asked. \"I have five stickers,\" Lydia said. \"No way! The box is huge. We'll need hundreds!\" said Kaitlyn. \"Sometimes you're so...six years old!\" Lydia felt angry. Just because she was six didn't mean her ideas were bad! \"Wait!\" Lydia said. \"Let's paint the box instead.\" \"That's a great idea!\" said Michael and Lainey. Kaitlyn didn't want to admit this was a good idea. \"Fine! Everybody go get some paint,\" she said. Kaitlyn always wanted to get her way. Michael came back with finger paint. Lydia came back with watercolor paint. Lainey brought a box of acrylic craft paint. Poor Kaitlyn could only find crayons. \"What do we do now?\" Lainey asked. \"We've got so many different kinds of paint.\" \"And crayons,\" said Kaitlyn, depressed that she couldn't find paint. \"Which will work the best?\" Michael asked. \"I think we just have to experiment,\" Lydia suggested. Kaitlyn didn't want to admit her sister had a good idea. \"I don't know about that,\" Kaitlyn said. \"But that's the best idea,\" said Michael. \"Yes,\" Lainey agreed. \"We need to try each kind of paint. Then we can see what works best.\" \"Whatever,\" said Kaitlyn. \"She's only six.\" Dad helped bring the refrigerator box into the backyard. Then he spread a large piece of plastic on the grass. This kind of plastic is called a tarp. Dad said it would stop them from getting paint on the grass. \"The grass is already green,\" he said. \"We don't need to paint it purple, too.\" Each friend chose a section of the box. They painted on it for the next 15 minutes. When they finished painting, they looked at all the sections. Together, they decided which paint worked best. Here's what they saw: The watercolor paint was too light. The crayons were too thick. The finger paint was too messy. \"The acrylic paint worked the best,\" Kaitlyn said. \"Sure did!\" everyone agreed. The four friends painted the refrigerator box to look like a bus. It took them all afternoon. They painted windows and doors. They even painted some kids inside the bus. \"It's so colorful!\" said Lydia. \"It's beautiful!\" Kaitlyn agreed. When they finished, Lydia looked to see what her sister had painted. On the back of the bus, Kaitlyn had painted a heart. It said: \"I love you, little sister.\" Lydia couldn't believe her eyes. \"I love you, too!\" she said. \"For a six-year-old, you're not so bad.\" \"All aboard the Lydia Express!\" everyone said. \"It was her idea to make a bus!\" They all climbed into the colorful bus. They drove wherever they felt like going. When they returned home, they had ice cream from the brand new refrigerator.

In fact, southern Florida is the only place in the world where alligators and crocodiles live side by side. The Everglades area is an ecosystem. Ecosystems are places where living things exist with nonliving things, such as water and soil. Everything in an ecosystem affects everything else. If something new is brought into the ecosystem, it may cause problems. Change caused by humans created big problems in the Everglades. As more people moved to Florida, new homes and businesses were needed. Because the Everglades area was large and beautiful, people thought it might be a good place to build. The ground, however, was too wet. In order to build homes, people drained water from some of the wet ground. Ta king water out of the Everglades caused many problems. Animals that ate water plants or small fish had a hard time finding food. The wood stork and other waterbirds began dying. People worried that this special place would be lost forever. Today, a portion of the Everglades is a national park. The law protects animals and plants there. Homes and businesses cannot be built inside Everglades National Park.

The bank is a rugged, rocky, undersea ridge about 100 miles west of San Diego, California. In some places, the ridge is only 3 feet below the ocean's surface. Strong winds from winter storms sweep across the ocean's surface. The winds push the water, causing huge waves to form when the water rushes over Cortes Bank. Because there is no land to slow the water after the bank, the waves stay large. According to weather experts, Cortes Bank produces waves that are more than 70 feet high.
