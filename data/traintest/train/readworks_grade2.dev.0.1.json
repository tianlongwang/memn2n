But cars did not always have seat belts. If a car stops suddenly, people are pushed forward in their seats. In the days before seat belts, more people were thrown out of cars in accidents. People started demanding that car companies do something to protect drivers and passengers. Companies began to develop seat belts. But designing the belts to work well was not a smooth process. The first seat belts only went across a person's waist. These belts attached to the base of the seat in the car. These new belts held people in their seats. However, many people were still hurt in crashes. New types of seat belts were tried. The best new ones went across a person's chest and waist. These belts keep a person's whole body from moving around. As a result, fewer people get hurt in car accidents. Although seat belts helped keep people safe, some people did not want to wear them. Later on, states passed laws that said people must wear seat belts. Today, all cars come with seat belts. Using seat belts makes everyone safer.

Because he was five years old, he thought this was awesome. \"Hello, lionl\" he yelled. The lion, a female with a patchy coat, opened one eye and stared at him lazily. Then she turned over and fell back asleep. James considered petting the lion or scratching its belly ,  Trixie, his old cat, loyed belly scratches ,  but he was proud enough of his new pet that he wanted to tell his parents first. He jumped out of bed and walked into the kitchen. His father was eating breakfast. \"Do you want me to strip the bathroom moldings this weekend?\" his father asked his mother. \"Or can it wait a week?\" \"It can wait,\" she said, frowning. \"But you should really want to strip the moldings.\" \"I got a lion!\" yelled James. \"That's nice, dear,\" said his mother. \"Well played, son,\" said his father. \"Most ?ve-year-olds go with something showier, like an ocelot or a puma. But you'ye gone the classic route.\" ?'ll \"Sure,\" his father said, \"everyone wants to ride their lion to school. But where will you park it?\" \"Bill,\" his mother said. 'We'ye talked about your sarcasm.\" \"It's not sarcasm,\" his father said. \"I'm being funn, \" James's father didn't get to finish his sentence. It was interrupted by an ear-splitting roar, coming from James's bedroom. For a few seconds, neither one of his parents said anything. \"Maybe I'll name her Tiger,\" said James. \"To confuse people.\" \"James,\" said his father quietly. \"What was that?\" \"Oh dear me,\" said his mother, crossing herself. James's father craned his head to peer down the hall towards James's bedroom. After a moment, he knelt down in front of his son and put his hands on his shoulders. \"James,\" he said. \"I need you to be completely, 100% honest with me. No make-believe, no story-time? Can you do that?\" James nodded. \"Sure I can.\" He noticed a droplet of sweat dripping down his father's forehead. \"O.l., great,\" said his father, in a strange, small yoice. \"James, is there a |ion...a real |ion...in your bedroom?\" \"Dad,\" said James, patiently. \"We've been oyer this.\" His father stared at him. James sighed. \"Of course there is, Dad.\" \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\" his mother screamed. \"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!\" \"Helen, stop it!\" snapped his father. His father stood up. \"This is ridiculous. I don't know what that noise was, but there is not a lion in your bedroom, James.\" James's father walked angrily to the broom closet. He opened the door, pulled out a mop with a long wooden handle, and began marching towards the hallway. \"For gosh sake, Bill,\" his mother said, grabbing him by the shoulder. \"Let's just get out of here and call the police. Or animal control. Or someone. Please.\" \"And tell them what?\" His father wheeled around to face her. \"What? That we have a lion in the house? Oh, I'm sure they'll send a car right out.\" \"Tell them her name is Trixie ll,\" said James. \"Someone might have met her before.\" \"Bill...\" \"I'm not calling anyone,\" his father said. With that, he turned and stomped down the hallway. James and his mother looked down after him. \"Quiet,\" his mother hissed. They watched his father approach the door. He reached for the handle and, holding the mop high in his other hand, gently swung the door open and poked his head around the corner. James barely had time to be curious about his father's reaction before his father turned on his heels, slammed the door shut, and went sprinting down the hallway towards James and his mother. \"Get out of the house right now!\" his father hollered as he ran. \"Go! Run! Now! Move! Move! Move!\" His father practically shoved James and his mother through the living room and out the front door. When they were outside, his father doubled over, panting for breath. \"Where in the world did you get a !!on?\" he yelled at James. \"You mean it's reef?\" his mother screamed, her eyes bugging. \"Ahhhhhhhhhh!\" \"They come from Africa, right?\" said James. By this time, neighbors had heard the commotion and begun gathering. Their next-door neighbors were the Horowitzes. Mr. Horowitz walked up to James's father. \"Bill, is something the matter?\" James's father turned and stared at Mr. Horowitz. \"There's a lion in my son's bedroom.\" Mr. Horowitz threw a quick, worried glance at his wife, who was standing on their front lawn. His wife shrugged. \"0.|.,\" said Mr. Horowitz, slowly. \"Do you want us to call somebody?\" \"Her name is Trixie ll,\" explained James. \"Or maybe Ms. Botticelli. I like how that name sounds\" \"Call somebody!\" his father yelled. \"Call anybody! There's a lion in my son's bedroom.\" By this time a dozen neighbors had gathered in front of James's house. All of them were yelling at each other, trying to figure out what had happened, when suddenly everyone froze. There, at the front door of James's house, was the massive African lion. Everyone stared at her, completely silent. For a few moments, the lion stared back. Finally, she let out a long sigh. \"Guys,\" the lion said, \"I know I'm a guest and I don't mean to be a pain, but I had a really late night last night and l have a client meeting at 10:00, so I was really hoping to sleep in. Do you think you guys could keep it down just a little bit? Thanks.\" And with that, the lion turned and walked back in the house. \"What about Rambo?\" said James. \"That's a cool name. Rambo.

Some engineers develop new medicines or find better ways to keep foods fresh and safe. Engineers start by identifying a problem to solve or a new product to design. They search for ways to fix the problem or make the product. They look at different ideas and choose the best one. Often, engineers make a model and test it. They look for ways to improve what they have made. Sandra Cruz-Pol is an engineer. She also teaches engineering students at a college.

Volcanoes are openings on the surface of our planet that can send lava, gas, and steam into the air. You may have seen volcanoes that look like mountains with openings at the top. Many volcanoes look like that. But others appear more like large holes, called craters, on the ground. Most of the world's volcanoes are found in an area that forms a shape like a horseshoe around the Pacific Ocean. Scientists call that area the \"Ring of Fire.\" Kilauea is a crater volcano. Lava from Kilauea has done a lot of damage. About twenty years ago, the lava flowed over a hundred homes, a church, and a store in the nearby Royal Gardens community. Those places were destroyed. In 2013, another lava flow ruined the only home remaining in that community. Today, Royal Gardens is no longer home to anyone. Scientists say Kilauea's lava threatens more homes and a forest preserve. The scientists are using computers to map the lava's path. They hope to predict what Kilauea will do in the future.

When it was really warm outside, he could walk in the water to cool off. The water was always cold. The leaves were just beginning to grow on the trees after the cold winter. Daniel wandered for a bit. He picked up a long stick and used it to clear a way through the forest. Suddenly, Daniel saw something in the distance that wasn't a rock or a leaf. When he got closer, he knelt down to investigate. He found a small injured bird between the fallen leaves. He looked around and saw a bird's nest sitting on a branch. He carefully climbed up the trunk of the tree with the nest to get a closer look. The nest was empty, and he didn't see any birds around. Then, he ran back to his house. \"Mom, I found a bird that's hurt!\" he told her as he ran through the door. She looked for a shoebox, and then she said, \"Well, let's go have a look.\" Daniel led his mom back to the injured bird. His mom knelt down and looked carefully at it. \"Let's try to save it!\" she said. She gently picked up the bird and put it in the shoebox. Then she said, \"We can take it to the animal hospital in town.\" They took the bird to the animal hospital. After a few days, the vet visited Daniel's house with the bird. It was healed. Daniel and his mom could hear the bird chirping when they opened the door. The vet said, \"The bird is ready to go back to its home in the trees.\" Daniel was so excited.

She is Celia the Brave, the greatest treasure hunter in the world. She digs with the shovel and pours the dirt into the sieve. Then, Celia, the greatest treasure hunter in the world, shakes the sieve all around. She shakes it very gently, up and down, then side to side. Shaking dirt around is one of her favorite things to do. When she does this, all the big rocks stay on top of the sieve. They are too big to fall through the holes. She finds rocks with beautiful stripes and patterns in them. The sun catches the edges of the rocks, and some of them shine like gemstones. The rocks she finds in her yard look different from the rocks she finds at her grandmother's house. She wonders why. For example, one rock she finds in her yard is broken in half, and she can see the inside of it. It has stripes and dots in it. It is grey and white. But the rocks from her grandmother's yard are orange. She asks herself why the rocks are striped with different colors and patterns. She walks into the kitchen. Her father is making dessert. He is a pastry chef at a fancy restaurant. His job is to make sweets all day. \"Are these jewels?\" she asks her father. \"Those are rocks,\" he says. But to her, they are still jewels. \"Why do they have stripes in them?\" Celia asks. \"I think you should do research at the library,\" her father says. \"You always say that!\" says Celia. \"I always say that because it's always a good idea,\" says her father. The next day, Celia puts her favorite rock in her lunchbox and brings it to school. All day, she feels like she has a secret. After school, she goes to see the librarian. She brings her secret rock with her. \"Hello Celia,\" says Mr. Beakman the librarian. \"I'm Celia the Treasure Hunter today,\" Celia explains. She shows him her favorite rock. \"I see,\" says the librarian. \"And I guess you want to know more about it.\" Mr. Beakman takes Celia to the computer. He types in \"Geology.\" Geology is the study of the physical earth, including rocks and minerals. He shows Celia where to find books on geology. But the books are for older, high school students, and there are many words she doesn't know yet. So she just looks at the pictures, instead. Celia sees pictures of fossils and dinosaur bones. In the next picture, a volcano erupts and a layer of lava pours over the dinosaur. That lava dries and traps the bones inside. The next series of photos shows a big piece of ice called a glacier. The glacier melts and runs down over the rocks. It pushes different rocks with it. It makes patterns on the rock called striations. Celia is confused. She understands how the water makes grooves in the top of the rock. But how would this make stripes inside of a rock? She goes home after school and finds her father in the kitchen. She shows him the book. \"Can you help me understand how stripes get inside of a rock?\" she asks. Her father looks at the book and nods. \"Do you see the dessert I'm making?\" he asks. \"It's called tiramisu. Watch how I make it. It might help you understand.\" First, he puts down a layer of tiny cakes called \"lady fingers.\" Celia giggles at the name. Of course, they aren't actually fingers! After he has one layer of cake, he spreads a layer of sugary cheese on top. This is followed by another layer of cake, another layer of delicious sweet cheese, and so on. The tiramisu is in a deep glass bowl, and you can see the layers through the glass. There is one layer of cake, and then there is one layer of cheese; it repeats all the way up to the top. \"It looks like a pattern,\" she says. \"It looks like stripes through the glass.\" \"Well, I'm no geologist,\" says dad. \"I'm just a pastry chef. But I think your rock was made in a similar way to my dessert. One layer at a time.\" He cuts a slice of cake and puts it on a plate. \"Now imagine that instead of cake, these layers were made of different types of rocks.\" \"I understand now!\" says Celia. Then she says, \"Good thing there are no dinosaur bones in my dessert.\" Celia and her father decide to eat some of the lesson. You can't eat rocks, but these layers are delicious!

How does an orange get from the tree to your refrigerator? People who work as fruit pickers move through groves filled with orange trees. When an orange is ripe, the picker clips it off the tree. All picked oranges are then carefully moved to a packing plant. In the plant, oranges are placed on a machine with moving rollers. Special brushes wash the fruit as it rolls along. Next, each orange is dried. Another machine lines up the oranges in boxes. A computer checks each box. Any oranges with spots or damage are removed. Orange growers want to produce good fruit that people will buy. Finally, each orange is given a sticker and placed in a box. Full boxes are shipped in cool trucks to stores. Each storeowner places the oranges on shelves. Then someone from your family comes to the store. Your family member chooses a few oranges, buys them, brings them home, and puts them in your refrigerator. Then, one day, you open your refrigerator, and there those oranges are, ready for you to eat!

Her brother had gone as a clown. They walked up and down their street and the two next to it. Every house they went to gave them candy. Some gave them lollipops. Some gave them caramel. But Keira's favorite was the houses that gave them chocolate. Keira loved chocolate. She liked milk chocolate and dark chocolate. She liked white chocolate and coffee-flavored chocolate. She liked chocolate drops, chocolate bars, chocolate oranges and chocolate eggs. She liked chocolate so much that, by the day after Halloween, she had no chocolate left. Tyler ate more slowly. He saved his candy. He ate just one or two pieces at a time. Last year, he made his Halloween candy last all the way to Thanksgiving. That made Keira mad. It was not fair that he could have candy for weeks and weeks, and she had none. That wouldn't happen this year. Tyler had a friend over. Keira had been watching them. When they went to the backyard to play, she sneaked up the stairs. She opened Tyler's door. She crept over to his bed. And now she was going to eat his chocolate. \"You're all mine,\" she said, and laughed a sneaky laugh. She unwrapped the first piece. It was a chocolate-covered cherry. She ate it.  \"Mmmm,\" she said. \"Mmmmmm.\"The next piece was a chocolate egg with marshmallow goo inside. She bit into it, and some of the marshmallow got onto her chin. She ate the rest of it. \"Marshmallow goo is the best,\" she said. Next she ate a chocolate shaped like a flower. Then she ate a chocolate shaped like a bunny rabbit. She ate chocolates with raisins inside, and chocolates with pink fluff, and some chocolates that had nothing inside them at all. Finally, she was going to eat all the chocolate she wanted. After a few minutes of eating, she heard footsteps on the stairs. She tried to get away, but her stomach was too full. Tyler came into the room. He looked mad. \"Hey!\" he said. \"What are you doing with my candy?!\" Keira tried to speak but she was too full. She stood up, and fell back down again. \"Oooooof,\" she groaned. Her face was covered with chocolate. Her hands were sticky. She even had chocolate in her hair. \"I don't feel so good,\" she said. \"I think I ate too much chocolate.\" Tyler started laughing.

They roam around the trees all day, every day, looking for food. Macy's favorite food is bananas. She is always looking for banana trees. When she finds one, she uses her trunk to pick the banana bunches from the top of the tree. Usually, it gets really hot in the jungle. One day, the sun is very strong, and the temperature is very high. Macy and her mom and dad use their big ears to cool themselves off. They flap their ears back and forth, trying to push away the heat. But it isn't enough - they are still too hot. The family of elephants walks around to look for a way to cool down. Macy sees a group of orangutans lazily lying on the branches of a big tree. They don't even move as the elephants walk past, too hot to do anything. A family of parrots flies by, but all Macy sees is a blur of red, green, and blue. The colorful birds land on a branch nearby, and Macy admires their bright feathers. Then, all of a sudden, Macy spots a loris sleeping on the tree that sits right next to the parrots. Macy gets excited - she never sees lorises because they are only awake at night. The small elephant stops to look at the small, fluffy animal. It has a tiny, round face and big, black eyes. Macy is about to take a step closer when her mom and dad pull her along with their strong trunks, not wanting to wait any longer to cool down. Finally, the three elephants find a big pool of water. They run into it and splash the cool water on each other. Macy feels so much better. She lies down and rolls around. She covers her body in mud. Elephants love to take mud baths. It cools their skin and protects them from bug bites. They all play in the water for a while, and other elephants come to enjoy the mud, too. Then Macy and her parents step out of the water and decide to go and find food. Macy spots a banana tree in the distance. She runs toward the bright yellow fruit. She grabs a bunch with her trunk and munches on the soft bananas. It's been a good day for Macy - bananas and a mud bath. What more could she ask for?

All these ferocious animals usually steal the spotlight at circuses. Circuses can be a lot of fun. Usually, there are popcorn, lion tamers, clowns, beautiful acrobats, and more. Even elephants walk across the stage with performers on their backs. But even with all the animals, one of the most exciting parts of the circus is the acrobats. Dressed in colorful costumes, these amazing performers fly over the stage on trapezes. Acrobats have to train for many years to do all of these dangerous stunts. It requires a lot of practice. The trapeze is one of the oldest circus acts around. When acrobats first begin to train, they typically start on the trapeze. Then, they can develop new skills. There are many different types of stunts that professional acrobats can do. Sometimes, performers use big pieces of silk that hang from the ceiling to the floor. They use their leg and arm strength to climb the silks. Then they spin, flip, and twirl with the fabric. They have to wrap the silks around their feet or wrists so that they can support their body. It is a big feat! Acrobats also perform on the lyra, or aerial hoop. A rope hangs a big hoop, like a hula hoop, from the ceiling. Acrobats hang off the hoop to do different tricks. They can flip around the hoop, or climb around it using only their legs or arms. This stunt also requires a lot of body strength. Sometimes, two acrobats use just one hoop at the same time to perform. This is a very hard trick! Some circuses only have acrobats. In New York City, there is one group called Lady Circus. These women are professional acrobats and have been training for years. They put on shows every month that always have a big audience. The acrobats wear very colorful costumes they make themselves. People love their performances! Since Lady Circus is loved so much, the acrobats often perform at other events around the city. But whenever they do perform, they always need high ceilings. They have to hang up their trapezes, silks, and hoops. Even though it is a lot of work, the members of Lady Circus love what they do.

Sometimes the earth shakes beneath people's feet. That shaking is called an earthquake. An earthquake can happen on land or in the ocean. Earthquakes can rattle walls, cause giant waves, and even bring down buildings. Here is why earthquakes happen. Earth is not one solid rock. If you could drill deep into our planet, you would find four layers. The top layer is the crust. Below the crust is the mantle. Under that is the outer core. The deepest layer of Earth is the inner core. The crust and the upper mantle are broken into giant pieces of rocks called tectonic plates. These plates float on top of the mantle like icebergs floating on the ocean. The plates move so slowly, however, that people cannot feel them moving. The plates sometimes move apart or slide past each other. One plate can even sink beneath another. But occasionally the edges of the plates get stuck. When that happens, pressure builds. Eventually, the pressure releases enough energy for the plates to break loose. A relatively small amount of energy is usually required for the plates to break loose, and the nearby ground shakesjust a little. Sometimes, however, a lot of energy is needed.

The judicial branch makes sure laws are written and followed correctly. This branch includes the United States Supreme Court. Nine justices serve on the Supreme Court.

The turtle is small, and as Clara looks closer, she sees that one leg is at an odd angle. \"I think I broke its leg,\" Clara's mom says. \"I'm really very sorry.

Phillip the turtle gets a little splint and bandage for his broken leg. The vet tells Clara that Phillip needs plants to eat and water to drink, plus a place to live. Clara and her mom buy a small tank at the pet store on the way home for the turtle to recuperate in. At home, Clara takes good care of Phillip the turtle. She puts water and rocks in the tank. She brings him fruit and leaves to eat, and keeps his water bowl clean. Phillip seems to be in a better mood. After eight weeks, Clara and her mom take Phillip back to the vet, who says that his leg is healed. Clara is both happy and sad.

When Kaitlyn and her sister Lydia came home from school, they found pink water all over the floor. \"Why on earth is this water pink?\" Kaitlyn asked. \"Because it's not water!\" Lydia said. \"It's strawberry ice cream!\" \"Oh no!\" Kaitlyn cried. Everything in the freezer had melted. Kaitlyn and Lydia always had ice cream or a Popsicle for dessert. Now dessert was liquid. This was a disaster! Quietly, Kaitlyn opened a Popsicle and dumped orange liquid into a cup. When no one was looking, she drank it. I won't tell on you,\" Lydia said. Then, she secretly drank a Popsicle, too. A week later, the new refrigerator arrived. It was big and silver. One of the doors had a special compartment to dispense ice. The best part about the new refrigerator wasn't the ice. It was the box it came in. The box was the size of a mansion. Later, Kaitlyn's friends Lainey and Michael came by to see the box. Lydia was there, too. \"Let's make a house out of it,\" said Lainey. \"No, let's make a fort,\" suggested Michael. \"Wait!\" said Kaitlyn. \"It's my refrigerator box. We should make a spaceship.\" \"Hey! It's my box, too!\" said little sister Lydia. \"Just because I'm only six doesn't mean I don't get a vote!\" Everyone stared at Lydia. They waited. What would her vote be? \"Well, vote then!\" \"I vote...\" she paused. \"I vote...\" \"Come on, Lydia!\" Everyone was getting impatient. Lydia stared at the ceiling. She got nervous when people stared at her. Finally, she made up her mind. \"I vote...to make a bus!\" she said. When Michael and Lainey heard this, they changed their minds. \"Yeah, we want a bus too!\" Now they had three votes for a bus but only one vote for a spaceship. The bus had the majority vote. \"Fine. How should we make this bus, smarty pants?\" asked Kaitlyn. \"We could cut holes in the box for windows,\" said Michael. \"I'm not allowed to use sharp scissors by myself,\" said Kaitlyn. \"We could use stickers,\" said Lydia. \"Where would we get enough stickers from?\" Kaitlyn asked. \"I have five stickers,\" Lydia said. \"No way! The box is huge. We'll need hundreds!\" said Kaitlyn. \"Sometimes you're so...six years old!\" Lydia felt angry. Just because she was six didn't mean her ideas were bad! \"Wait!\" Lydia said. \"Let's paint the box instead.\" \"That's a great idea!\" said Michael and Lainey. Kaitlyn didn't want to admit this was a good idea. \"Fine! Everybody go get some paint,\" she said. Kaitlyn always wanted to get her way. Michael came back with finger paint. Lydia came back with watercolor paint. Lainey brought a box of acrylic craft paint. Poor Kaitlyn could only find crayons. \"What do we do now?\" Lainey asked. \"We've got so many different kinds of paint.\" \"And crayons,\" said Kaitlyn, depressed that she couldn't find paint. \"Which will work the best?\" Michael asked. \"I think we just have to experiment,\" Lydia suggested. Kaitlyn didn't want to admit her sister had a good idea. \"I don't know about that,\" Kaitlyn said. \"But that's the best idea,\" said Michael. \"Yes,\" Lainey agreed. \"We need to try each kind of paint. Then we can see what works best.\" \"Whatever,\" said Kaitlyn. \"She's only six.\" Dad helped bring the refrigerator box into the backyard. Then he spread a large piece of plastic on the grass. This kind of plastic is called a tarp. Dad said it would stop them from getting paint on the grass. \"The grass is already green,\" he said. \"We don't need to paint it purple, too.\" Each friend chose a section of the box. They painted on it for the next 15 minutes. When they finished painting, they looked at all the sections. Together, they decided which paint worked best. Here's what they saw: The watercolor paint was too light. The crayons were too thick. The finger paint was too messy. \"The acrylic paint worked the best,\" Kaitlyn said. \"Sure did!\" everyone agreed. The four friends painted the refrigerator box to look like a bus. It took them all afternoon. They painted windows and doors. They even painted some kids inside the bus. \"It's so colorful!\" said Lydia. \"It's beautiful!\" Kaitlyn agreed. When they finished, Lydia looked to see what her sister had painted. On the back of the bus, Kaitlyn had painted a heart. It said: \"I love you, little sister.\" Lydia couldn't believe her eyes. \"I love you, too!\" she said. \"For a six-year-old, you're not so bad.\" \"All aboard the Lydia Express!\" everyone said. \"It was her idea to make a bus!\" They all climbed into the colorful bus. They drove wherever they felt like going. When they returned home, they had ice cream from the brand new refrigerator.

Television sets that could broadcast in color have been around for a long time. An engineer named John Logie Baird invented a color TV set in the 1930s. But the picture on Baird's TV flickered, and was not clear. Companies would not sell a TV that was not good quality. For many years, people worked to improve how color televisions worked. Over time, companies found ways to make the picture clearer. The improvements also meant that a user could turn a dial to add just the right amount of color to the picture. By the late 1960s, many people were buying color televisions. Soon, most TV shows were being broadcast in color, and most people in the U.S. had color TV sets.

Ecosystems are places where living things exist with nonliving things, such as water and soil. Everything in an ecosystem affects everything else. If something new is brought into the ecosystem, it may cause problems. Change caused by humans created big problems in the Everglades. As more people moved to Florida, new homes and businesses were needed. Because the Everglades area was large and beautiful, people thought it might be a good place to build. The ground, however, was too wet. In order to build homes, people drained water from some of the wet ground. Ta king water out of the Everglades caused many problems. Animals that ate water plants or small fish had a hard time finding food. The wood stork and other waterbirds began dying. People worried that this special place would be lost forever.
