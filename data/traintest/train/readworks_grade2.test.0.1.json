I leaned in and licked his nose. \"Argh! I thought you were going to give me a kiss on the cheek!\" he said. I wiggled under the sheets. \"No, Dad! I'm a kitten, remember? You just said.\" \"That isn't quite what I meant,\" Dad said. He hugged me under the covers and asked what I wanted for breakfast. \"Since you're up so early, we may as well eat!\" \"I want pancakes,\" I told Dad, as he lifted me from the bed and set me down onto the floor. \"Pancakes, eh? That's a big job for just one dad to take on,\" he said, spreading the quilt flat over the bed. \"I am going to need some help.\" At that, I stood still in my red pajamas with the train cars on them. Help Dad cook? Use the stove? I had gotten burned on the stove before, yanking the handle on a pan of bacon and splashing some grease onto my fingers. Suddenly I couldn't move. I wiggled my toes just to make sure I hadn't turned to stone. \"Mew,\" I said. Dad seemed to notice that I was scared. \"It's okay, Jack. I'll help you, you know! But I can't do it all alone if we're going to make enough pancakes for a hungry kitten and also his dad!\" He took my hand, and we walked downstairs together. In the kitchen, Dad took out ingredients from the pantry: flour, sugar, baking powder, and oil. Dad said, \"Can you get me the milk and one egg?\" I opened the fridge and handed him the carton of milk. I tried to give him an egg, but I dropped it onto the floor. \"Never mind, kiddo. It's no big deal,\" Dad said, handing me a rag to wipe up the yolk. I got another egg and cracked it into the mixing bowl. Then I helped whisk the batter together while Dad heated up some oil in a skillet. I stood on my little footstool when he poured the first ladleful of pancake batter into the pan. \"Ready to flip it, Champ?\" \"Dad! No! That's the scariest part! I got burned the last time I touched a pan!\" \"Well, you won't ever get over it if you don't try again, will you? And this happens to be the part of the pancake-making process where I need the most help.\" Little bubbles began to appear in the middle of the pancake batter in the pan. The edge of the pancake was turning brown. Dad handed me a spatula, and I squeezed the handle while I stared at the pancake, about to burn unless I acted fast. My stomach felt like it was full of little birds flapping around, and I remembered the blister I got from the bacon grease burn. And then, with one hand, I gripped the handle of the skillet. \"I'm a chef!\" I shouted, flipping the pancake over with a slap and a sizzle as the uncooked side hit the pan. \"You did it!\" Dad gave me a high-five. \"You want to do the rest of them?\" \"No,\" I said.

Shortly before 10 p.m., a siren went off. A mile-wide tornado was approaching Greensburg. Its winds were estimated to be more than 200 miles per hour. In less than ten minutes, the town was destroyed. Ten people lost their lives. When the storm had passed, people climbed out from their storm cellars through the rubble. Cars and trucks had been thrown about. Homes were crushed, or simply ripped from the ground. \"I'm in downtown Greensburg. There's really nothing left,\" said one resident. How do tornadoes form? A tornado is a swirling,  funnel-shaped  column of wind. It starts with a thunderstorm. Thunderclouds form when warm, wet air collides with cool, dry air. Then, strong winds form a wide tube of spinning air. When the tube touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.Kansans are used to tornadoes. The people of Greensburg live smack in the middle of \"Tornado Alley.\" It is an area that spans eight states in the central United States. This region has just what tornadoes need to get started: cool, dry air from the Arctic mixing with warm, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico. There is a lot of wide open space, called the Great Plains, for tornadoes to form. These conditions give rise to more than 600 tornadoes, on average, in \"Tornado Alley\" every year.How do scientists predict dangerous storms? Meteorologists are scientists who study and forecast weather. They use a technology called radar to track storms, including tornadoes. Radar gives them information about how far away the tornado is and how fast it is moving. Although tornadoes have fast swirling winds, tornadoes themselves move relatively slowly (18 to 30 miles per hour). So their paths can be predicted with reasonable confidence. A system of tornado watches and warnings is used to alert the public to danger. A tornado \"watch\" means thunderstorm conditions exist that could set off a tornado. A \"warning\" means a tornado has touched down and been spotted. This system saved many lives in Greensburg. After the tornado sirens shrieked, people had 20 minutes to escape to their basements and storm shelters before the tornado destroyed their town.", "author": "This article is provided courtesy of the American Museum of Natural History", "id": "255706", "title": "Spinning Storms"}, "question2DialogQueue": {}, "assertions": [], "questions": [{"text": "What happened to the town of Greensburg in 2007?

You may be surprised to hear that earthquakes are not rare. In fact, earthquakes happen every day somewhere in the world. Most of them are weak. There are times, however, when an earthquake is very powerful and causes a lot of damage. One strong earthquake can destroy houses, bridges, railroad tracks, and more. Earthquakes are caused by the movement of huge pieces of rock under Earth's surface. The pieces are called tectonic plates. These plates are found in the top layers of Earth, called the crust and the upper mantle. Tectonic plates have rough edges and are always moving. Usually, they move slowly. But there are times when the plates get stuck against each other. If that happens, pressure builds up. When the two plates finally get \"unstuck,\" they release energy. Often, a small amount of energy is released. That will mean a small earthquake. However, sometimes a lot of energy is released.

He kicked at the ground with his foot, twisted his body around, and looked up at his mother with tears in his eyes. Billy was angry. His mother was a nurse, and she had a new job at a senior center. \"Old-folks home,\" Billy called it. \"Senior Center,\" his mother corrected. Billy didn't like the seniors. He didn't like the senior center. He thought it was boring. Billy's mother wanted Billy to come to the senior center every day after school. Billy wanted to go to see his friends or play video games at home. Billy's mother wouldn't let him. \"I don't have a babysitter for you,\" she said. \"And you can't go to a friend's house unsupervised every day.\" The senior center was across the street from Billy's school. \"Come meet me at the center at 3pm,\" his mother directed. \"You can stay here until my shift ends at 4:30.\" So it was decided. Every day after school Billy said good-bye to his friends and walked over to the senior center. \"Hello, Billy. How was school today?\" asked Curtis, when Billy came in. Curtis was the building's security guard. \"Hello. Curtis. School was okay,\" Billy said. Every day at the senior center started like that. Billy would then go to the nurse's station where there was a quiet room. He would do his homework, then sit and stare at the walls. Billy would try to look as bored and as miserable as possible, in the hope someone would notice and convince his mother to let him go home. He would sit and think of his friends, home playing video games. He thought ofthe worlds he could be creating and the monsters he could be slaying. If only he were playing video games, too. Billy's mother didn't appreciate any of this. \"You're being ridiculous,\" she said. \"Why are you acting this way? The senior center isn't torture. There's a lot you could do here. I don't understand why you're being so dramatic,\" said Billy's mother, exasperated. \"Why don't you help me or Curtis?\" \"No, thanks,\" said Billy, who would go right back to looking miserable. After a few days of this routine Billy did start to get bored. His plan wasn't working. His mother wasn't giving in. Billy was going to have to get to like the senior center. The next day after school Billy went to the senior center. He said hello to Curtis and went to the nurse's station. He did his homework. This time, for a change, when Billy finished his homework, he decided to go exploring. Billy left the nurse's station and turned right down the hallway. He had never seen the rest of the facility. The building was huge. Every hallway looked the same. Billy followed the hallway until it came to another hallway. After a while, Billy was lost. Billy sat down in the hallway and tried to remember the way back. He didn't want to ask directions. He wasn't supposed to be there. He didn't want to get in trouble. So he sat and tried to remember the way out. He heard something coming from the door nearest him. \"Oh, for goodness' sake, Henry,\" said a woman. \"You don't look anything like a Knight of the Realm. You look more like an elephant.\" \"An elephant! Ifl look like an elephant, you look like a peacock,\" a man's voice replied. \"They must be residents,\" thought Billy. Curious, he crawled over and peeked inside the room. He saw something he had not expected. The woman who was speaking had on a pink track suit and an even pinker feather boa around her shoulders. The man she was speaking to was sitting in a wheel chair, holding a shield and sword, and wearing a helmet. The shield, sword, and helmet were made of paper and glue. They had begun to droop a little. Billy supposed this was why he looked like an elephant. Billy was starting to laugh when he saw the woman in pink looking at him. \"Well, don'tjust sit there spying. Come on in,\" said another man. This man was speaking to Billy. He walked in. \"Who are you?\" they asked. Billy explained that he was waiting for his mother, the nurse. The seniors introduced themselves. The woman in pink was named Mildred. The man with the shield was Harold. \"Pleased to meet you,\" said Billy. He asked them what they were doing. \"We're rehearsing for the talent show,\" said Mildred. \"You have a talent show here?\" asked Billy. \"Of course,\" said Mildred. \"We're the Senior Center Dramatic Society. We always perform in the talent show, and we rehearse even when there isn't a show coming up. Sometimes we make up our own plays.\" \"It's important to be creative,\" said Harold. \"It keeps you young.\" \"Would you like to help us?\" asked Mildred. \"We need an impartial critic.\" \"My mother told me I'm dramatic,\" said Billy. \"Great,\" said Mildred. \"You'll fit right in.\" Billy agreed to help. He helped them read their lines and fix their costumes. Afterwards, they took Billy back to the nurse's station where his mother was waiting. \"Did you have fun?\" his mother asked Billy. \"Yes, I did,\" Billy answered. From that day on Billy spent his afternoons at the center with the Dramatic Society. The seniors weren't boring at all.

Long ago, farmers used windmills to pump water and make flour. Each windmill had blades at the top of a tower. When the wind blew, its power made the blades spin. The spinning blades turned a pole inside the tower. The pole then ran a water pump or moved a stone that ground, or mashed, grain into little pieces. Today, people have learned how to get much more power from the wind. We have made a lot of progress! Now we have wind turbines. These turbines are modern windmills. Wind turbines have large blades at the top of a high pole. The blades spin quickly when the wind blows. When the blades spin, they power a generator. That is a machine that makes electricity. Electricity brings light and power to homes and businesses. Wind turbines are often built in a group in many rows. That group is called a wind farm. Wind farms produce a large amount of electricity.

H was it made in the past? Do we produce it differently today? Long ago, working women called milkmaids poured cow's milk into pans. The milkmaids knew that when milk got warm, part of it turned into cream. They waited till cream rose to the top of the milk. Then they removed it and let it get sour. That gave the cream flavor. These workers poured the sour cream into wooden tubs called churns. Churns had big paddles that had to be pushed and pulled. That hard work turned cream into butter! The butter was rinsed with cold water. Finally, salt was added to keep the butter from spoiling. Today, we produce butter a little differently. First, cow's milk goes into big cans that spin the milk. Cream moves to the top. The cream is heated to kill germs. The cooled cream goes into a metal churn that spins like a clothes dryer. The churn tumbles the cream. Soon, butter forms. Salt is added, and the butter is churned again. That butter is sent to a packager. It is shaped into sticks, wrapped, and sold to grocery stores. Then people buy it and take it home!

I hope we're a million years late, and by the time we get to the music school, piano doesn't even exist anymore. The people of the future will be smart. They'll understand that mankind is better off without the piano. They'll understand me.\" \"Okay, sweetheart. That's great. Please get in the car.\" \"No. On no account. This is America, Dad. Didn't you hear? Nobody can make anybody play piano against her will. It's called democracy.\" \"Angela? If you don't get in that car right now, your mother is going to be very angry at me. And if she's angry at me, I'm going to forbid you from using the computer.\" \"For how long?\" \"Until Christmas.\" Dad wasn't joking. Angela got in the car. As they drove, beads of sweat formed on the back of her neck, and her stomach started to feel like she had just swallowed a hockey puck. Practicing piano scared her to death. Her teacher, Mr. Poliakoff, was a hairy old man who talked with a lisp that made him nearly impossible to understand. She could never tell if he was saying, \"I see,\" or calling for a \"high C.\" Uncertainty made Angela nervous, and nerves made it impossible for her to play. Not that Angela wanted to play anyway. She thought that there was no music on Earth more boring than Mr. Poliakoff's sheet music. For three months, she had gone once a week to learn famous compositions like \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,\" \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat,\" and \"Three Blind Mice.\" As boring as those songs were, they were apparently impossible to play. Each time Angela picked up her fingers she was seized by fear. What if she played the wrong note? Would Mr. Poliakoff shout at her? Or, worse, would he simply shake his head in disappointment? \"Fear is the enemy of success,\" he would tell her, except that when he said it, it sounded more like \"sushshesh.\" But when it came to the piano, fear was all Angela had. \"Timbuktu,\" she said. Her dad looked away from the road to give her a funny look. She went on. \"Antarctica. The Yukon. Kazakhstan. Borneo. Tasmania.\" \"Yes?\" asked her father, finally. \"I'm trying to think of places I'd like less than piano class.\" \"Did you come up with anything?\" \"Nope. Even the middle of the Amazon rainforest would be more fun.\" \"Well, I'm glad you've been studying your geography, at least.\" When her father looked away, Angela stuck out her tongue. That would show him. As usual, Mr. Poliakoff's music school smelled like cabbage. Angela did not know where he might be cooking the foul vegetable, but she was certain she didn't want to find out. She trudged down the darkened hallway like her feet were made of rocks, glad her father wasn't there to tell her she was going to be late. \"Not that he cares anyway,\" she thought. \"He's done his job, dropping me off at the building. He doesn't even care if I actually make it to class.\" Angela's eyes went wide. She had an idea. She pressed her back against the wall and slinked away from Mr. Poliakoff's classroom. She would have to spend an hour in the music school, but that didn't mean she had to learn any music. She tip-toed down the dark corridor, fearful that her piano teacher might burst out at any moment and bellow, \"You! Come here and practice 'Ring Around the Rosie!'\" But the door did not open. Mr. Poliakoff did not catch her. Angela was free. She was sneaking her way to the front door of the music school, planning on passing the hour in the sun, beneath a tree or on a bench, when she heard a funny sound. It sounded like someone playing the piano, scales, but it sounded different than what she was used to. It sounded like the person playing was having fun. She followed the sound. It was coming from one of the classrooms. She peered through the glass window and saw that the piano bench was empty. Feeling sneaky, she turned the handle and padded into the empty classroom. The music was coming from a computer in the corner. She walked towards it, dying to find out what it was, when she learned the room wasn't as empty as she had thought. \"Hello?\" said a voice that stopped Angela's heart. It came from a woman with long, gray hair and a mouth that twisted up a little bit at the sides. \"Can I help you?\" \"No,\" stammered Angela. \"I, uh, Ijust heard the music, and, \" \"Do you like the piano?\" \"I hate the piano,\" said Angela. The woman started to laugh. \"Well!\" she said. \"That's too bad for you, since you're in a music school.\" \"No kidding.\" \"I'm Mrs. O'Hara.\" \"That's nice. I should be going.\" \"Hold on, hold on. You wanted to know about this music?\" Angela was silent. \"Come on. It's okay to be curious. Do you know anything about jazz?\" \"No.\" \"Well, here it is.\" She turned up the volume. The man playing piano tapped at the keys like a baby hitting something with a hammer. He sang like a clown, making strange noises and putting on all sorts of funny voices. The words he sang were even stranger: All that meat and no potatoes All that food to the alligators, yes. Hold me steady. I am ready For all that meat and no potatoes. \"It sounds so silly!\" \"Well, that's Fats,\" said Mrs. O'Hara. \"Who's Fats?\" \"Fats Waller. The piano player. He's the one who wrote the song.\" \"A grown-up wrote this song?\" \"A very talented grown-up. Don't think about the silly words. Listen to the piano. What does it sound like?\" \"It sounds crazy.\" \"It's all over the place, isn't it?\" Mrs. O'Hara was right. None of his notes were where Angela was taught they were supposed to be. He played fast when he should have played slowly; he played slowly when he should have played fast. In between lines, he would shout nonsense like, \"Oh, stop it, Thomas! You're tickling early!\" Crazy was the only word for it. \"Who's Thomas?\" asked Angela. \"I don't know.\" \"Huh. Well, I guess I should get going.\" \"You're supposed to be in class, aren't you? With Mr. Poliakoff?\" Angela made a face. \"You're going to make me go back to class, aren't you?\" \"I'm going to make you learn a little piano,\" said Mrs. O'Hara. \"Because that's what your parents paid for.\" \"Can I play a song like this?\" \"Not quite yet. Fats Waller spent a lot of time learning to play normal piano before he could start playing it crazy.\" \"He played 'Ring Around the Rosie?'\" \"And 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,' and 'Three Blind Mice,' and all of Mr. Poliakoff's favorites.\" \"But ifI learn to play those...eventually I can play this?\" \"You got it,\" said Mrs. O'Hara, as she sat down beside the bench. Angela put her fingers on the keys and prepared to play. Her fingers weren't afraid any more. ", "metadata": "Grade: 2 Lexile: 560L", "author": "W.M.

He was not happy- Jenny's dad, Bill, was walking down the path to the farm. He saw Jake stop. \"Aww, poor Jake,\" he said. \"He's just barn sour!\" \"What does barn sour mean?\" Jenny asked. \"It means he wants to go back to the barn. He is hungry and tired. Jake is a sweet horse, but he'll be sour now until he gets home.\" Bill smiled. \"So barn sour is bad?\" Jenny said. \"Jake is bad?\" \"No, Jake is not bad.\" Bill said. \"We all get tired and hungry sometimes. Maybe you should take him home now.\" Bill walked to the barn. Jenny frowned. \"But I want to go to the pond,\" she said. She got down from Jake and pulled his rope. Jake's head came down toward Jenny. But his feet did not move. Jenny pulled again, using both hands. She pulled hard. Her small round face turned red. Her hair flopped up and down on her back. Jake took two steps down the path to the pond. But then he stopped again. Now he looked mad. Jenny was mad now, too. She pulled one more time, even harder. Her boots kicked up a cloud of dust from the path. \"Come on, Jake!\" This time, Jake didn't go to her. He pulled, too! Jake was a big, strong horse. Jenny was a small girl. Jenny could not stop Jake. And she didn't just step. She flew! The rope fell. Jenny fell. It hurt. She looked at Jake. Jake looked at Jenny. Then, he put his head down and started eating the grass near the path. Jenny knew she was not going to win. And now, she was tired too. She could hear Bill ringing the dinner bell at her house. Jenny sighed. She got back onto Jake. \"Come on, Jake,\" she said. \"Let's go home. I'm sorry. I think I am barn sour too.\" Jake seemed to nod. They walked together toward home.

American farmers plant corn seeds in the spring when the weather is warm enough. If a farmer plants when the soil is too cold, the seeds will rot. Corn needs plenty of space to grow. It has to have a lot of sunshine and the right amount of water. If farmers have good weather, they can pick their corn by September. If the weather is too dry or cold or stormy, the corn may not grow very well. When it is ready, many farmers sell their corn. People buy corn to eat, of course. Some companies buy corn to feed to farm animals. Other companies buy it to produce different foods or drinks. There are even companies that buy corn to make fuel for cars! That fuel is called ethanol. When the growing season is over, farmers let their fields rest. In the spring, many farmers will plant corn again.

In order to do that, they needed to buy some art supplies. They needed paint, brushes, and a canvas. Alison liked to plan ahead. She wanted to pick an aisle to meet in, but Molly refused. \"Can't we have an alternate plan?\" Alison begged. \"Just in case?\" \"No way! I have my phone, and you have your phone. Just text me when you get to Circle's. It will be easier that way.\" Alison had to admit, using the phone to find each other did sound like the easier idea at first.

Instead, she'd have to take an elevator to the fourth, and walk back down a flight of stairs. That meant the third floor was only accessible by the fourth floor. Alison's head started to spin. Paint was on the third floor, but she was on the first. This was going to be confusing! She went upstairs, then back down again. But she got lost! Alison walked down an extra flight of stairs and ended up on the second floor. Then she had to start all over again. When Alison finally got to the third floor, she saw Molly standing in the paint aisle trying to call her. \"Where have you been?\" Molly asked, flustered. \"I have been trying to call your phone for twenty minutes!\" \"Well,\" said Alison, \"I guess you could say I've been walking around in circles.\" ", "metadata": "Grade: 2 Lexile: 580L", "author": "Kyria Abrahams", "id": "254359", "title": "Buying Paint Supplies"}, "question2DialogQueue": {}, "assertions": [], "questions": [{"text": "Where was Alison supposed to meet Molly?

We can see those drops of water hang in the air as fog. Layla loved winter at the park, too. The cold temperatures made the lake freeze. When the ice was thick and safe, people went ice, skating.

The water mixes with the salt and minerals. Then it flows into the oceans. Scientists have discovered two other sources of salty ocean water. Some salt comes from underwater volcanoes. Other salt spurts from heated vents on the ocean floor. Most ocean salt, however, starts on land. Lakes are large bodies of water. They are surrounded by land. Lakes usually have fresh water, but some lakes have salt water. The Great Salt Lake in Utah is a saltwater lake. Lake water does not move from place to place. Rivers are filled with freshwater that moves from one place to another. The water in rivers comes mostly from rain. Rivers usually flow into oceans. Streams and creeks are also bodies of moving fresh water. They are smaller than rivers. Streams and creeks can come together and form larger streams or rivers.

He collected thick animal hairs, called bristles. He attached the hairs to a handle made from animal bone. Addis found that lots of customers wanted his invention. People still wanted to improve the tooth cleaner, however. Animal hairs did not feel great against human teeth! Finally, man-made bristles were created. They were made out of nylon. Then plastic was used for handles. Now toothbrushes could be made quickly and cheaply. Millions were sold. About fifty years ago, the electric toothbrush was invented.

Her big sister, Beth, was with them too. Cindy hadn't come yet. Her mother wanted her to get started on packing. They were going to Salvador on the northeast coast of Brazil. Cindy's father had been talking about it for six months. But the girls thought it wouldn't happen. And now she was going. They could not stop her. Cindy was very sad when she came. She said she didn't want to go. She didn't even know where Salvador was. But she knew it was very far and she wouldn't see her friends every day. How would she get there? How would she take all her books and toys, and clothes? And she could not take her house. Or her dog Biscuit. Where would she live? Cindy wanted to hide in Joanna's house, so her parents couldn't take her away. But wouldn't they find her sometime? How would Cindy find out more about what it would be like? \"It's easy. There are a number of ways to solve problems like this. We can use designs, sketches, or physical models to figure it out,\" said Beth. Joanna took the atlas out. It was a book with many maps. Beth helped them find Salvador: \"See Cindy! Here we are - in North America. And Salvador is in Brazil; in South America.\" \"It's not so far,\" Cindy said, looking at the map. \"No, it isn't,\" Mona added. \"And look here, Sao Paulo is in Brazil too! They have a pancake festival there every year in the summer.\" Cindy was excited now. \"I love pancakes!\" Draw a Sketch. Lydia took out a sketch pad and some pencils, and gave them to Cindy. \"Now imagine,\" she said to her. \"You will be living in a new house. Isn't that wonderful?\" Joanna said, \"Let's see how we want your new home to be.\" The girls started drawing. \"Well, that's what people do before they build a new house!\" said Beth. They drew many rooms: for Cindy's books, her clothes, and her new dog (who would also be called Biscuit). Cindy looked at the drawing. She decided to take it home for her parents. They needn't worry about the new house now. She had a plan! Design a Model. \"But how will I get there? And will I be able to take all my things?\" The girls knew she would be going in an airplane. But none of them had ever traveled in one. Does a plane have wings? How does it fly? Will it carry all of Cindy's things too? Now Beth gave them each a colored origami paper. They made their own airplanes! As they were doing that, Beth explained to them how airplanes worked: where the engine was, where the pilot sat, and where Cindy's books and toys would be kept. They saw the wings - just like a bird's! They flew them all around the room. Cindy would be flying too! All the way to Salvador. \"Now wouldn't that be fun?\" Lydia asked. Cindy could imagine Sao Paulo, the pancakes, the plane, and another Biscuit. She was finally excited! Just then, Joanna's mother walked in with the phone.

Long ago, however, cameras had not been invented yet. How did people back then record important moments? Some people told stories about old times. Others wrote down what they remembered. Some people made special drawings to help them recall important moments. Among those people were Native Americans of the Lakota tribe. Every year, Lakota leaders decided which event was most important. A Lakota artist was then asked to draw a special picture of that event. Because each year's picture was decided on during the winter, the drawings became known as winter counts. For a long time, winter counts were drawn on animal skins. Later, the drawings were done on paper. The pictures told the history of the tribe. Each year, the newest winter count was added to the Lakota collection of pictures from earlier times.

Long ago, farmers used windmills to pump water and make flour. Each windmill had blades at the top of a tower. When the wind blew, its power made the blades spin. The spinning blades turned a pole inside the tower. The pole then ran a water pump or moved a stone that ground, or mashed, grain into little pieces. Today, people have learned how to get much more power from the wind. We have made a lot of progress! Now we have wind turbines. These turbines are modern windmills. Wind turbines have large blades at the top of a high pole. The blades spin quickly when the wind blows. When the blades spin, they power a generator. That is a machine that makes electricity. Electricity brings light and power to homes and businesses. Wind turbines are often built in a group in many rows. That group is called a wind farm. Wind farms produce a large amount of electricity.

The west coast is home to many large waves. Cortes Bank is the site of some of the largest and fastest waves in the world. The bank is a rugged, rocky, undersea ridge about 100 miles west of San Diego, California. In some places, the ridge is only 3 feet below the ocean's surface. Strong winds from winter storms sweep across the ocean's surface. The winds push the water, causing huge waves to form when the water rushes over Cortes Bank. Because there is no land to slow the water after the bank, the waves stay large. According to weather experts, Cortes Bank produces waves that are more than 70 feet high. That's as tall as a seven, story building! Some waves move at more than 30 miles per hour.
