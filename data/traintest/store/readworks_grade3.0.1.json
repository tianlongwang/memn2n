        "author": "W.M. Akers",
        "text": "Melissa had a cat that loved her too much. The cat was named Roger. He was an elder cat, about 10 years old, Melissa guessed. She knew because her parents told her they get Roger not long after Melissa was born. When she was little, Roger was little, too. They would run and play and fall down together. Now that she was bigger, Roger was big, too. Very big. Possibly, she thought proudly, he was the fattest cat in town. But more importantly, he was the sweetest. When Melissa watched TV, Roger sat on her lap. When she did her homework, he sat on her paper. When she ate, he ate, too. Everywhere Melissa went, Roger followed. \"That cat loves you so much,\" Melissa\u0027s mother would say. \"He doesn\u0027t know what to do without you!\" Most of the time, this was great. Other girls had dolls. Other girls had stuffed animals. Other girls had guinea pigs and hamsters and hermit crabs, pets that were usually in cages or tanks. But Melissa didn\u0027t need any of that. She had a big fat kitty that followed her everywhere. Yes, it was all pretty great, until Melissa tried to go to sleep. At night, Roger would sit outside her door perched like a hen on an egg. All night long, Roger would wait for Melissa to wake up. At first, he would wait quietly. But after a few hours, he would start to get impatient. Every night, at around one in the morning, Roger would start to yowl. If you do not have a cat, you do not know what an awful noise a yowl can be. Cats make lots of nice noises, like purring and meowing and sneezing, but a yowl is not nice at all. It starts deep inside their throat and moves up slowly, getting louder all the time. \"Heeeeeee, yowl!\" Roger would say, over and over again. It sounded like he was being stepped on. It sounded like he was in pain. And it woke Melissa up every time. Her eyes would pop open. Her stomach would twist up. She would lie there for hours, listening to Roger\u0027s awful cry. No human is strong enough to sleep through a yowling cat. \"Mom!\" Melissa would say the next day. \"Roger was yowling again last night. He kept me up for hours!\"Oh sweetie,\" Mom would say. \"He just can\u0027t stand to be without you. He loves you too much. Why don\u0027t you just open your door and let him in?\" Melissa tried this once. When Roger started yowling, she stomped across her room and opened the door. He bounded in. She lay back down, and tried to go to sleep. She could n\u0027t. It isn\u0027t easy to sleep when a cat is walking on your head. She moved Roger, but he came back. She hid her head under her blanket, but he just poked her over and over again with his paw. When he started to yowl again, Melissa got fed up. She jerked the blanket off her head and stood up. \"Oh no you don\u0027t!\" she said. \"No yowling in here!\" She put Roger out into the hall where he started his song again. \"Mom!\" she said the next day. \"Roger kept me up all night! First he walked on my head and then he kept yowling!\" \"Oh dear,\" said Mom. \"I guess he just loves you too much. I have an idea. Take this spray bottle to bed with you. When he starts making noise, just give him a little squirt. Cats hate water. He\u0027ll run right away.\" That night, Roger started yowling on time, at 1 am. sharp. Melissa was waiting for him. She gave him three quick squirts with the bottle, and he ran away. \"Mmm,\" she said. \"Now I can get some sleep.\" But five minutes later, the cat was back, yowling away! Over and over she squirted him, and over and over he came back. \"What a piece of junk!\" she said, and threw the bottle into the trash. Outside, Roger yowled some more. \"Fine!\" she shouted. \"You win!\" She opened the door, and Roger bounded inside. Soon he was sound asleep, cuddled on top of her head. Melissa didn\u0027t care. She would rather have a cat for a hat, she decided, than a cat that wouldn\u0027t be quiet. "

        "text": "Haboob! One day in 2011, in Phoenix, Arizona, a woman was getting in her car, which was parked in her driveway. Suddenly, her husband ran out of the house. He was waving his arms and yelling. \"Haboob!\" he yelled. Without another word, the woman ran back in her house and shut the front door. The husband and wife stood at their front window. A few minutes later, the sky began to darken. And then, sand began to swirl around the house. Soon, sand and dust were everywhere, blowing all around the house. This lasted for almost an hour. The woman and her husband were watching a type of dust storm, called a \"haboob.\" A dust storm is a kind of storm where wind picks up sand and dust from the desert and blows them into the air. Phoenix is built in the middle of the Sonoran Desert. It gets several haboobs every year. Most of these haboobs are very small, but some of them are very big. The large haboob that hit Phoenix in 2011 was more than a mile tall and 50 miles wide. The storms can last for up to three hours. Haboobs happen in other countries too. Countries in the northern part of Africa can get long haboobs. If a haboob strikes near a farm, it can cover the farm with dust and sand. This means the farmer can no longer plant crops. Often the farm must be abandoned. Haboobs may have a funny name, but they can be very dangerous. When a ha boob hits, it makes it very difficult to see. If you are outside during a haboob, you may not be able to see more than a few inches in front of you. When a haboob is approaching Phoenix, the local weather stations start broadcasting warnings for people to get off the street. People are told to park their cars, so they don\u0027t crash. Airplanes are not allowed to take off from or land at the Phoenix airport because the pilots cannot see well. The dust in a haboob can also make people sick. Some of the dust can carry pesticides and toxins. People go inside during a haboob so that they do not inhale the dust. People with pets, like dogs and cats and horses, also bring their animals inside so that they do not get sick. Weather forecasters are always trying to get better at predicting when a ha boob will happen. The sooner they know a haboob is coming, the sooner they can warn people about it. The sooner people are warned about a haboob, the more lives will be saved. This is because more people will be able to get to safety before the haboob strikes. Paul Fisher and his family have lived in Arizona for more than 20 years. He can remember seeing many haboobs during that time. One time, he was out walking his dog, .limbo, shortly after he had moved to Phoenix. As he was walking, he looked out at the desert and saw what looked like a big, dark wall. He stared at it for a few minutes. Suddenly, he realized what he was looking at. He grabbed Jimbo and ran back to the house. He was just able to get inside before the storm hit. \"Once you\u0027re in a haboob, you never forget it,\" he said. \"It\u0027s like a thunderstorm, but instead of rain, all you can see is sand.\" "

        "text": "Tamara opened her eyes and jumped out of bed. Most days she hated getting up early. But today was different. Today Tamara was wide awake and excited. Today her family was going on a hike. This was Tamara\u0027s first hike. She pulled on her new shoes and tied the laces. Tamara\u0027s mother had bought the new shoes just for the hike. They were brown boots. The bottom of the boots was made of rubber and had curves to help Tamara walk on rocky ground. Tamara put on pants, a shirt, and a big jacket. She was ready to go hiking. \"Tamara,\" her mother called. \"Are you ready?\" \"Yes, I am!\" Tamara said. Tamara ran down the stairs. Her mother and older brother James were there at the bottom. They were all wearing new boots like Tamara\u0027s. James was hopping up and down impatiently. Everyone was ready for the hike. Tamara\u0027s family got into the car. They drove for two hours until they were far away from the city. Once they left the city and the suburbs, there weren\u0027t many buildings beside the road. Instead there were trees and fields. Tamara saw herds of cows chewing on grass. The road climbed up. They were driving into the mountains. Tamara rolled down her window. The air was cool and she liked it. It smelled like leaves and flowers. Soon, Tamara\u0027s mother parked the car. \"Are we here? Is this the hike?\" asked Tamara. \"Yes,\" said James. \"See that trail? That\u0027s where we\u0027ll start hiking.\" James had hiked this trail before and it was one of his favorites. Tamara looked at the trail. It was a dirt path and went into the forest. Tall trees and tiny flowers lined both sides of the path. Tamara, her mother, and her brother began to walk. Butterflies and bumblebees flew over the flowers. At first the bees made Tamara nervous, but soon she saw that they were more interested in the flowers than they were in her. Tamara\u0027s mother talked about the other times the family had gone hiking. James talked about the time he went camping with the Boy Scouts. Tamara wanted to talk, but she felt out of breath. The trail was steep. They had been walking uphill for an hour by now. Tamara took hold of her mother\u0027s hand. \"I\u0027m tired,\" she said. \"Come on, Tamara,\" said her brother. \"You can do it! You\u0027re ten years old. That\u0027s old enough to hike.\" Tamara kept going. If her brother said she could do it, Tamara knew she could do. James never lied. They kept walking uphill. Tamara looked around at the plants to keep her mind off of how tired she felt. There was green everywhere. There were trees with long draping leaves that Tamara had never seen before. She saw a small and furry rabbit by the side of the trail. Tamara gasped with surprise and the rabbit ran away at the sound. \"Look, Tamara!\" her brother called suddenly. The trail had ended. Tamara and her family were at a pool at the bottom of a waterfall. Tamara looked up at the water rushing down and at the fish swimming in the pool. Her mother sat on a rock at the edge of the pool and began to unpack their picnic. There were peanut butter and banana sandwiches, baby carrots, and chocolate chip cookies. Tamara took off her boots and sat on the edge of the rock. As she bit into her sandwich, she dipped her toes into the cool water. \"Congratulations Tamara!\" said her mother. \"You just finished your first hike!\" Tamara smiled. She decided that she liked hiking. "

        "text": "Jonny took his dog, Scruffy, out for a walk on a cold day in December. He bundled up in his heavy winter coat and put on his thick wool cap and heavy mittens before he said goodbye to his mom. Outside the front door, the whole world was like a winter wonderland: there were icicles hanging from tree branches and snow banks that rose all the way up to Jonny\u0027s knees. Scruffy was excited to be outside and scampered around, digging in the snow and jumping into drifts. Jonny was also glad to be out in the cold air. The blizzard that left all this snow had raged for two days, and he hadn\u0027t been allowed to go outside, even just to catch some air! They walked through Jonny\u0027s neighborhood, passing people who looked glad to be outside, too. A few blocks down, Jonny saw his friend Marcus building a snowman with his big sister, Marie. \"Hi, Marcus!\" Jonny called out. He walked over to the snowman. \"Hey, Jonny. You want to help?\" Marcus was patting the bottom part of the snowman with his glove, while Marie was rolling together the second section of the snowman, packing the snow together to make sure it stayed in a round shape. Jonny walked over and wrapped Scruffy\u0027s leash around Marcus\u0027 mailbox. Together, Jonny, Marcus, and Marie built an amazing snowman. They fashioned a long pointy nose out of many small twigs pulled together in a tent shape, and eyes out of bruised green apples Marie found in the house. They made the snowman\u0027s arms out of two longer sticks, setting them up to make it look like he was waving. Sometimes Jonny would look over and Scruffy would be digging again, but he mostly sat patiently, watching Jonny, Marcus, and Marie work. When they were all done, Marcus and Marie\u0027s mom came outside to see their work. \"This is an amazing snowman!\" she said. \"Does anyone want hot chocolate?\" All three kids and Scruffy ran into the house and warmed up. After about an hour, Jonny decided it was probably time to go home, the sun was beginning to set, and it was starting to get very cold. As he was saying goodbye to Marcus, Marie, and their mom, Scruffy ran out into the yard, ignoring all of their calls to stop and come back. All of a sudden, Scruffy jumped up and gave the snowman a big bear hug. \"Oh no!\" Jonny yelled, and ran out to the snowman, which was now a pile of snow and sticks on the ground. Marie and Marcus ran out behind him. All three looked down at the remains of the snowman and then at Scruffy, who was staring up at them, panting and smiling. \"Oh well,\" Marcus said. \"We can build another one tomorrow.\" Jonny apologized for Scruffy and clipped the leash back onto his collar. Marcus was right. Tomorrow was a new day and could mean another snowman. Jonny walked Scruffy home as the sun set. Maybe tomorrow he would build a snow-dog. "

        "text": "Maggie and Samantha are identical twin sisters. They were born just a few minutes apart, and they look exactly alike. They live with their mom and dad in Pennsylvania, and they go to the same elementary school. Because Maggie and Samantha look exactly alike, sometimes other students at school have a hard time telling them apart. Maggie has blonde hair and so does Samantha, just like their dad does. Maggie has green eyes and so does Samantha, just like their mom does. They are around the same height too. Maggie and Samantha like going to the same school. This is because they are not just twin sisters, but best friends too. Every morning they take the yellow school bus from their house, and they sit together in the same seat. The sisters always have a lot to talk about, and they like to talk on the bus. They have a lot in common. Both girls enjoy a lot of the same television shows, books, and food. Both girls spend a lot of time together with their family, and they both like to play with their dog, Callie. But even though Maggie and Samantha look alike and share a lot of the same interests, they are also very different. Maggie likes to play sports. She is on a soccer team and a basketball team. Samantha doesn\u0027t really like sports. She likes to dance, and on the days that Maggie plays soccer, she goes to take jazz and tap-dancing lessons. There are other differences between them too. Maggie likes to read mystery books, but Samantha likes to read books about animals. Maggie\u0027s favorite dinner dish is spaghetti with meatballs, but Samantha\u0027s favorite dinner dish is sushi. Maggie gets better grades in reading and Spanish, but Samantha gets better grades in math and science. Maggie likes to stay up late, and Samantha likes to go to bed early. Maggie likes the color red, but Samantha likes the color green. Even though two people may come from the same family or look the same or have a lot in common, it does not mean that they are exactly the same. Everyone is different in her or his own way. That is what makes Maggie Maggie. And that is what makes Samantha Samantha. Maggie and Samantha like being different from each other as much as they like being similar. That is what makes them special. "

        "text": "\"I want to see the bears!\" \"I don\u0027t care. I want to see the whales first.\" \"But bears are so much better.\" \"Yeah, if you\u0027re seven. I\u0027m ten now. I like whales.\" \"So what? I want to see the bears.\" \"I don\u0027t care! Coming to the museum was my idea, and we\u0027re seeing the whales first.\" \"Bears!\" \"Whales!\" \"Bears!\" \"Whales!\" \"Mommmmm! Graham is being mean!\" shouted Sarah. Everyone in the main lobby of the Museum of Natural History turned to look at her. Mom turned around with an embarrassed look on her face, the one that she called mortified. \"What did he do?\" whispered Mom. \"He said that bears are for little kids, and that we have to see the whales first.\" \"We\u0027re going to see evervthing in the museum. We have all afternoon.\" \"But I want to start with the bears.\" \"Then you should have asked nicer instead of shouting. Graham, take us to the whales.\" Sarah\u0027s heart sank. Graham didn\u0027t even have to say anything. The look he gave her was bad enough. He was smiling ear to ear like one of the chimpanzees in the Africa exhibit. She dragged her feet all the way to Ocean Life. She knew she shouldn\u0027t have shouted, but Graham made her so angry. And the simple fact was, they didn\u0027t have all afternoon. It was 3:00 PM now, and the museum closed at 5:15 PM. Sarah had seen the sign. She had read her mother\u0027s watch. She knew there was not much time left for bears. Ever since they started learning about them the year before at school, Sarah had had bears on the brain. She had paid extra close attention during that unit and now knew all sorts of facts about bears. Grizzly bears were some of the biggest in the world, and they were her favorite. \"Did you know,\" she asked her mother, \"that grizzly bears can get as big as 850 pounds?\" \"I did, Sarah. You mentioned that several times in the car.\" \"Well, did you know they can run 35 miles an hour?\" \"Yes, I did.\" \"That\u0027s speeding in some places!\" said Sarah, but Mom didn\u0027t seem to care. \"Whales are way bigger than bears,\" said Graham. \"That means they\u0027re better.\" \"Yeah, but whales live in the ocean.\" \"So what\u0027s wrong with the ocean?\" \"It means they\u0027re wet all the time. And they; smell like fish.\" \"You smell like fish!\" Graham cracked up. Clearly, he thought he was very clever. \"How big are whales?\" asked Sarah. \"What do vou mean?\" \"Grizzly bears weigh 850 pounds. How much do whales weigh?\" \"Uh...I don\u0027t know. A whole lot.\" Sarah scoffed. Graham didn\u0027t even know anything about whales. He just wanted to make sure she was unhappy. She had been looking forward to this trip for months. She read about the museum online, about all the dioramas that were built in the 1940s. They were a very, old- fashioned kind of exhibit, but they looked beautiful in the pictures. It was as close as she could get to a real bear, and she had stayed up all the night before thinking about it. And now Graham was ruining the fun. The Ocean Life exhibit was dark and quiet. Spooky sounds filtered down from the speakers which were supposed to make them feel like they were underwater. Sarah didn\u0027t feel underwater. She just felt grumpy. \"Oh look,\" she said. \"A whale.\" \"That\u0027s a humpback whale,\" said Graham, doing his best to show off. \"No it\u0027s not. It\u0027s a beluga whale. Read the sign.\" The model of the beluga was one of the ugliest animals she had ever seen. It had a smooshed- up face and a sad grey color, and it looked like it definitely smelled like fish. \"Well I think it\u0027s so good that I\u0027m going to stand here and appreciate it,\" said Graham. \"For a while.\" \"Mom, can I please just go look at the bears by myself?\" asked Sarah. \"No,\" said Morn. \"You have to stay in this room.\" As Graham pretended to be interested in the whale, Sarah watched the seconds tick by on her mother\u0027s watch. Finally, she couldn\u0027t take the beluga any longer. She stomped away, her arms swinging at her side, looking desperately for something in the Ocean Life exhibit that wasn\u0027t ugly, boring, or stinky. And then, from across the room, she saw it. It was a diorama of Alaskan seals swimming just below a sheet of ice. Above them, peering hungrily into the water was a polar bear, looking so real that Sarah flinched when she saw it. It had snow-white fur, a wet-looking, black nose, and claws as sharp as razor blades. As Sarah pressed her face up against the glass to look at it, she forgot about the whales behind her. The polar bear was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. "

        "author": "Michael Stahl",
        "metadata": "Grade: 3 Lexile: 880L",
        "text": "Miss Blake wanted to show her third grade class what it\u0027s like inside a courtroom of the United States, so she decided to stage a role-play. There are many different people in the courtroom during a trial. All of them have different but important jobs or roles. Miss Blake put her students\u0027 names inside a hat. Next to the hat, she had a list of the different people who participate in a trial. As she went down the list of courtroom jobs, she picked a student\u0027s name out of the hat. She then assigned the student to act out that role in the class role-play. Miss Blake thought it would be fun, and it was! First on the list was the judge. Miss Blake chose Matthew Schwartz to play the judge. The judge sits high above everyone else in the front of the courtroom. He or she decides what is fair or unfair in the trial. He or she must try hard not to form an opinion on whether a person is guilty of a crime or not. Many people think thejudge decides who is guilty or not, but that is not always true. In some cases (called bench trials), the judge decides the outcome of the trial. In other cases (jury trials), a jury decides the outcome of the trial. The jury is a group of up to 12 citizens. In the United States, people are asked at random to be a part of the jury in a trial. They listen to evidence that is brought up. This evidence proves facts that can suggest the person accused of the crime is either guilty or innocent. The jury has to listen to all of it. Then, all ofthe people on the jury vote on whether or not the person is guilty. The trial does not end until enough of the jury members agree on whether or not the person is guilty. Miss Blake chose twelve boys and girls to play the jury, and all of them were excited to listen to the evidence from the two lawyers. A lawyer\u0027s job is to use evidence to convince the jury that their version of what happened is right. One lawyer wants to show that a person is guilty of a crime. That lawyer is the prosecutor. The other lawyer, the defense lawyer, hopes to prove the person is not guilty. Christina Slick became the prosecutor, and Jeffrey Gecko was chosen as the defense lawyer in Miss Blake\u0027s class role-play. In the courtroom, there is also a bailiff and a court reporter. The bailiff stands close to the judge. His or her job is to make sure there is order in the court! Miss Blake thought that Jack Foster would be a great bailiff, and luckily picked his name out ofthe hat for thejob. The court reporter writes out everything being said during the trial. This is important in case someone wants a statement repeated later on. Miss Blake chose Daisy Frank for that job. The last person Miss Blake needed to choose was someone to play the defendant. The defendant is the person accused of doing some crime. They may not have actually committed the crime, however. The jury will decide whether the defendant committed the crime at the end of the trial, after the lawyers have shown all of their evidence to the court. Miss Blake chose Charlie Samuels to pretend to be the defendant, but reminded the class that Charlie was only going to act like a bad boy who was accused of stealing a hot dog at lunch. Now that all of the roles had been chosen, the courtroom role-play could begin! "

        "title": "Cold Feet",
        "author": "W.M. Akers",
        "metadata": "Grade: 3 Lexile: 550L",
        "text": "When someone says they have \"cold feet,\" it means they are afraid to do something they\u0027re supposed to do. That wasn\u0027t Louis\u0027 problem. Louis actually had cold feet. They felt like icicles. |cic|es on top of ice cubes. Inside of ice water. It was very cold in his bedroom. \"I wonder if this is what Antarctica is like,\" Louis said. \"I\u0027m glad I\u0027m not a penguin.\" Louis lay in his cowboy pajamas, curled into as tight a ball as he could. He was supposed to go to sleep, but to go to sleep meant he had to stretch out his legs. And even though he was supposed to do that, he was afraid. So maybe he had both kinds of cold feet, after all. That afternoon, it had snowed for the first time all year. Louis and his friends spent the whole day outside. They built snowmen. They sledded down the hill behind the school. They had snowball fights with Louis\u0027 neighbor. All day long, they had so much fun that Louis didn\u0027t notice how cold his feet were. After a while, in fact, he didn\u0027t notice his feet at all. They were totally numb! When he got home, Louis kicked the snow off his boots, unzipped them, and yanked them off his feet. He peeled off his socks, and was shocked by what he saw. His feet were as white as the snow outside! He poked his left foot. He poked his right foot. He didn\u0027t feel them at all. \"Uh...Mom!\" he said. Louis\u0027 mom told him to run a hot bath. He stuck his feet in the steaming water and gradually, feeling returned. The feeling that returned was hot. \"Too hot!\" said Louis, and yanked his feet out of the tub. He dried them as well as he could, but he must not have done such a good job. By the time he climbed into bed, his feet were still a little damp. It was cold in his room, very cold, and cold air, plus wet feet, can only mean one thing. His feet had frozen again. \"Brrrr!\" said Louis. \"Brrrrrrrrrr!\" He thought if he \"brrrr-ed\" loud enough, his mother would hear him. If she knew how cold his feet were, she would bring warm socks. She would bring extra blankets. She would bring hot water bottles. Louis trembled at the thought of how wonderful a hot water bottle would be. He \"brrrr-ed\" as loud as he could, but Mom didn\u0027t hear. Louis looked across his room at the closet. There were no hot water bottles in there, but there were socks. There were blankets. If he could get to his closet, he could save himself. But he couldn\u0027t get out of bed. He wasn\u0027t sure his feet were any good to walk on anymore. And the hardwood floor, shiny in the moonlight, looked as cold as the inside of a freezer. It was too cold to sleep, and too cold to walk across the floor. \"This is a pickle,\" said Louis. \"Brrrr,\" he added, just to himself. A shiver hit him. A bad one, that went down his spine like lightning across the night sky. He straightened his legs all the way, sending his feet right down to the coldest part of the bed, and then curled back up into his ball. \"Yikes!\" It was cold down there. Cold like the deepest, darkest part of a cave. Cold like the bottom of the ocean. Cold like outer space. And he was going to have to stick his feet down there. There was no question of getting up and getting a blanket. Socks were not coming to help. Louis was not getting out from under his blanket, and that meant he\u0027d have to warm the bottom of the bed up himself. He kicked his legs out. He kicked them around, running in place. He tried to rub the cold sheets as much as possible to make them warm. This, he had learned in science class, is called friction. Friction makes heat, and he needed as much heat as he could get. He ran in place until his legs were tired, and then he stopped. He paused. Would his feet freeze again? It was cold down there. Not as cold as it was before, not very cold, but still chilly. He felt the warmth fade. About to panic, he looked around for something to help. Beside the bed, just within arm\u0027s reach, were the clothes he had been wearing that afternoon. He grabbed his pants, shirt, long underwear and big winter coat. He piled them on top of his feet. They locked in the heat, and he knew his feet would eventually get cozy under there. Now, Louis could sleep. He was feeling warmer already. "

        "text": "Makavla gentlv placed her black witch\u0027s hat on top of her black curls as she looked at herself in the mirror. Her mom had painted her skin green and outlined her eves in purple paint. She wore tall, black boots underneath a long, purple dress. It was October 31-\", and she was ready for trick- or-treating on Halloween night. \"Makavvvlai\" her mom called out from downstairs. Makavla\u0027s two friends, Colden and Porter, had arrived. Colden stood in the doorway, his costume blowing in the wind. A white sheet hung over his head, and his eves peered out from two cut-out holes. Porter decided to dress like his favorite superhero, Batman. A black mask covered his face and a long cape trailed behind him. They carried plastic pumpkin bowls to collect candv later in the evening. The two boys greeted Makavla with equal levels of excitement. \"Hi, Makavla!\" Colden said. \"You ready to go trick-or-treating?\" Porter asked. She nodded her head and ran to grab her coat. \"Let\u0027s go, everyone!\" her mom called out, and thevr all marched out the front door. All around them, children and parents walked from door to door in colorful costumes. Carved Jack-o-lanterns sat in front of houses, candles shimmering inside the orange pumpkins. A breeze blew past Makayla and her friends, making her shiver. The weather had just started to get colder. Makayla remembered her class earlier that day, when her teacher talked about the origins of Halloween. Mrs. Narula told Makayla and her classmates that the holiday started with an ancient festival called Samhain, 2,000 years ago in Ireland. The word Samhain means \"summer\u0027s end\" in Gaelic, a language spoken in Ireland and Scotland. Mrs. Narula looked at different documents from the American Folklife Center to find out about Halloween\u0027s history. She found that the festival celebrated the end of summer and the beginning of winter, a time to gather crops to prepare for the colder months. The Celtic people who celebrated this festival also believed it was the time when all the souls who had died that year traveled to the next world. To keep the dead spirits away, people lit bonfires. For ceremonies, some dressed in animal furs to disguise themselves so that the dead spirits would not be able to recognize them. Mrs. Narula said this is one reason why we might still dress up in costumes today. Later, the festival of Samhain was replaced with All Souls\u0027 Day, a Christian holiday that honored the dead. People celebrated with bonfires and parades. They also dressed up in costumes as saints, angels, and devils. Porter reached up and pressed the doorbell at the house across the street. Diiiing-dong. A big, green Frankenstein pulled open the door, holding a big bowl of wrapped treats. Makayla and her friends gasped, and then laughed when they realized it was just Mr. Clock dressed up. \"Trick-or-treat!\" the three sang with big smiles. As Mr. Clock sprinkled candy into their baskets, Makayla thought of Mrs. Narula again. \"In the 18005, many people from Ireland and Scotland came to the United States to start a new life,\" the teacher told her students earlier that day. \"Even though their ancestors had their own trick-or-treating traditions, they started their own in their new country.\" Mrs. Narula had read an article by Benjamin Radford, a man who researches science and history. He wrote that teenagers in those communities started to play pranks during Halloween celebrations. Adults tried to stop the pranks by giving children candy instead. And the tradition still remains today with children all around the world dressing up for candy! "

Everyone came over to their house: aunts and uncles and cousins. Even a long-lost aunt from Alabama. They ate turkey and mashed potatoes and stuffing and gravy. Lots and lots of gravy. It was great. It made everyone sleepy. But when everyone left, the food was still there. Turkey. Mashed potatoes. Stuffing. Gravy. Everywhere! The counters were covered. Food invaded the fridge. It sat on Caroline and Stewart\u0027s plates for days and days. Eventually, it got boring. \"Pleeeeeeeeeeease,\" said Stewart. \"Make us something else!\" \"Not mashed potatoes.\" \"Anything but that!\" \"Hmm,\" said Mom. She was quiet for what seemed like a long time. Her finger tapped against her mouth. \"I think I have an idea.\" She took out a container. Stewart\u0027s mouth fell open. \"Mom!\" he shouted. \"Are you crazy? Those are the mashed potatoes.\" \"They sure are,\" said Mom. \"I think | just remembered something my grandmother used to do.\" Mom pulled out a frying pan and a jug of vegetable oil. She poured the oil in the pan. It went glug, glug, glug. She turned on the heat. Stewart and Caroline backed away. They are not allowed near the stove when hot oil is in the pan. While the oil got hot, Mom fixed the potatoes. She turned the container upside down. \"Plop!\" went the potatoes. They fell onto the counter in a cold, hard block. With her sharpest knife, Mom sliced the potatoes into squares. She dusted them with flour. She sprinkled them with salt. She covered them with pepper. And then she slid them into the oil. Sizzle! went the oil. Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle! \"Whoa, Mom,\" said Caroline. \"What are you doing?\" \"I\u0027m frying the potatoes. The same way you would make French fries. It\u0027s a good way to get rid of leftovers.\" When the potatoes stopped sizzling, they were done. Mom lifted them from the oil and let them dry. Once they were cool, Caroline picked one up in her hands. \"Don\u0027t you want one, Stewart?\" \"No!\" he said. \"I told you. No more mashed potatoes.\" Caroline lifted the block of crisp, brown potato to her mouth. She took a tiny bite, the tiniest bite in the world. \"Oh boy,\" she said. \"Oh boy, Stewart. These are good.\" He took a bite, too. She was right. The potatoes didn\u0027t taste like mashed potatoes at all. They were crisp and brown on the outside. They were creamy and fluffy on the inside. It was like eating a crispy cloud. \"See?\" said Mom. \"Leftovers aren\u0027t the end of the world.\" "

        "author": "",
        "metadata": "Grade: 3 Lexile: 660L",
        "text": "She sat in front of the window, curled into a ball, feverishly licking herself. She was brown, black, grey, and orange, all the colors a cat can be swirled into a crazy patchwork. She looked like she had been the sole witness in the explosion of a paint store. \"You are a very lovely cat,\" Aggie said. \"I wish I knew what you were doing here.\" The cat looked up and meowed, as if to say she was asking herself just the same question. Aggie had come home from school that day, same as always. She had fixed herself a plate of graham crackers and peanut butter, same as always. She had sat down on the couch to watch afternoon TV with the cat, same as always. Only one thing was different: this was the wrong cat. Aggie\u0027s beloved cat Princess was jet black and on the heavy side. This interloper had an air of the jungle about her. She was muscular, smaller than Princess, and apparently much more fit. \"What did you do to my cat?!\" asked Aggie, her mouth full of graham crackers. \"How did you get in here? We don\u0027t have a cat door. We didn\u0027t leave any windows open. Did you teleport in through the glass? Or have you always been living in the house, and you just now decided to show yourself? Do you have an evil plan? Although it appeared to consider her words carefully, the cat said nothing. Aggie turned off the TV in disgust. She was going to have to deal with this herself. Taking the cat in the crook of her arm, she carried it outside. The cat wriggled in her arms, but Aggie held her tightly. \"I\u0027ve already lost one cat today. I\u0027m not losing another one.\" She peered under bushes, behind the garbage cans, and in the secret corners inside the garage. Princess was nowhere to be seen. As she grew desperate, she eyen looked in the mailbox. The longer the search went on fruitlessly, the more the strange cat twisted in her arms. Finally, she started to hiss and claw. \"Fine! You want to come down, you come down.\" Aggie set the cat down carefully. It did not run away. \"That\u0027s right. You stay close.\" As Aggie walked, the cat walked beside her, showing no inclination to run. A few times it crept off silently to nose into a patch of overgrown grass or bushes, apparently helping in the search for Princess. They found no sign of the vanished kitty. \"I guess I should try to figure out who owns you,\" Aggie said. She knocked on her neighbor\u0027s door, and Mrs. Munson opened it. She was a crag, faced woman whose constant scowling made her look older than she really was. \"What do you want?\" asked Mrs. Munson, suspicious as always. \"My cat Princess is missing, and, \" \"Do you think I\u0027m stupid? You have a cat right there.\" \"I know, but this isn\u0027t my cat. You see, \" \"So now you want two cats? That seems awfully greedy.\" \"Actually, I wanted to ask if this was your cat.\" \"I hate cats!\" \"Do you know who she belongs to? Or have you seen any other cats wandering the, \" \"No! Unlike you, I have more important things to do than think about cats. Good-bye!\" When Mrs. Munson slammed the door in Aggie\u0027s face, the strange cat rubbed her head against Aggie\u0027s ankle in sympathy. The next neighbors were less angry, but no more helpful. No one had seen Princess, and they had no idea whose cat this was. And even though nobody was quite as mean as Mrs. Munson, they all gave the distinct impression they did not care about Aggie\u0027s problem. \"You lose a cat, you find a cat,\" said Mr. Tanner. \"You break even. What\u0027s the problem?\" \"But...l want my cat!\" Mr. Tanner shrugged and closed his door. Aggie and the strange cat padded to the edge of his front lawn to sit on the curb and sulk. It was getting dark now, and Aggie\u0027s parents would be home soon. She had two mysteries on her hands, where this cat came from and where her cat went,  and felt in her bones that if she let the sun go down without solving them, she never would. Beside her, the strange cat crouched and began to purr. There was something in the bushes. \"Princess?\" Aggie called. The bushes rustled louder. The strange cat lowered her stomach to the ground and pulled herself through the grass like a soldier might. Without meaning to, Aggie mimicked her, crouching as low as she could without falling over. They crept forward together as the bushes rustled louder and louder. Aggie leaned forward, one palm in the dirt, and tore the bushes open. The cat pounced, startling the shadowy creature hiding inside. \"Princess?!\" asked Aggie, as the animal turned and ran away. She was about to go after it when a glimmer of light from a passing car illuminated it briefly. \"Unless Princess was dressed up for Halloween that was a raccoon. That\u0027s my mom\u0027s car. Let\u0027s go home and see whether or not we can explain this mess.\" Aggie hefted the cat and trudged home. She opened the door and cried a forlorn, \"Hey, Morn. \"Hey, sweetheart,\" said Mom. \"What\u0027s going on ?\" \"I\u0027ve got some news about the cat.\" Aggie walked into the living room, making eye contact with her mother and preparing to deliver the bad news, but her mouth couldn\u0027t form words. There was Princess sitting right beside Mom on the couch, same as always. \"The cat, sweetheart?\" \"We, uh... the strange cat entered from outside. We have two of them now.\" Mom looked as surprised to see the new cat as Aggie was to see the old. As the two cats met each other, Aggie stared at Princess, dying to know where she had been. Princess looked at her, black eyes shining and yawned, as if to say that she would never tell. "

        "text": "The morning she left for Camp Kanawa, Maria awoke with a lump in her throat and an ache in her stomach. She had gone on plenty of sleepovers. She\u0027d even spent a whole weekend at Aunt Jolie and Uncle Ed\u0027s. So why was she so nervous? No breakfast today, she thought, imagining the ache turning into nausea and a horrible road trip after a full meal. Then the smell of French toast wafted upstairs. As usual, Maria\u0027s stomach grumbled as soon as the French toast-scented air hit her nostrils. 0n the other hand, maybe a good breakfast is exactly what I need. She gave her arms and legs a good stretch and ambled downstairs. \"There\u0027s my big camper!\" her mom said, squeezing Maria\u0027s shoulders with one arm the way she did when she wanted to give a hug but was in too much of a rush for a full embrace. She walked briskly to the stove, placed two pieces of French toast on a plate and tapped a canister above them, powdered sugar snowing down. \"Just like you like it: super fluffy, slightly crispy...\" \"...and lightly dusted,\" said Maria, already in position, armed with knife, fork, napkin and full glass of milk. Maria poured a puddle of maple syrup beside the toast and topped each piece with a little mountain of whipped cream. \"Get started while it\u0027s hot. Your father\u0027s coming down in a minute. I told him to shave. Don\u0027t want the grizzly bear, I mean, grizzly beard, to send your new bunkmates running for the woods.\" \"Okay, okay,\" Maria\u0027s dad said with a sneaky smile. \"Clean as a whistle. Just like you ordered.\" \"Just like I ordered?\" \"The mustache stays. Admit it, you love it.\" Maria\u0027s mom shrugged. \"I think it\u0027s hip,\" Maria said, dipping a bite in some syrup. \"Well, your old man is hip,\" her dad said, moving his head the way he did when he wanted to look like a cool surfer dude but looked more like an Egyptian robot. \"In fact, I was the most popular kid at my camp.\" \"For the record, it was science camp,\" Maria\u0027s mother reminded her, \"and his rise to fame was thanks to what was known as The Great Explosion.\" \"Accident or genius? The world may never know,\" Maria and her dad said in unison, using their deepest, most mysterious voices. They slowly broke out of character and into laughter. \"In all seriousness, Maria, popularity is not important,\" her mother said, looking her straight in the eyes. \"Finding the people who like you for you, that\u0027s what matters.\" \"Your mom speaks the truth, Sugar,\" said Maria\u0027s dad, wiping his thick mustache with a napkin. \"Just be yourself. You\u0027ll have a blast.\" Just be yourself. Just be yourself. Maria repeated the words like a mantra as she sat with her new cabin mates in a circle on the grass. \"Cool bracelet,\" said the skinny, freckled redhead sitting next to her. \"Thanks. I made it in an embroidery class I took this winter.\" \"Whoa! That\u0027s impressive. Can you teach me how?\" \"If you teach me how to do a braid just like the one in your hair. I\u0027ve mastered the art of French toast eating, but definitely not French braiding.\" A loud whistle hushed the girls\u0027 laughter and buzzing all around them. They looked up to see a beautiful older girl blowing into an acorn top between her thumbs. Her skin was tan and eyes were dark brown, like Maria\u0027s, but her dirty blonde hair made Maria feel bored of her plain, black hair. \"Hello! I\u0027m Audrey, one of your two cabin counselors.\" \"And I\u0027m Gina, your other cabin counselor,\" said the pale girl with curly, brown hair and eyes that were icy blue in color, yet warm. \"And you ladies are the Dragonflies!\" Audrey lifted her arms in the air as she announced it. \"Each cabin here at Camp Kanawa is named after a different insect.\" \"The Cockroach boys, age twelve and thirteen like you, think they\u0027ve got the best mascot. I beg to differ. Dragonfly girls are as tough as dragons and graceful as...well, dragonflies.\" \"That sounded better when we rehearsed it,\" Gina said lightheartedly. The ache in Maria\u0027s stomach had officially turned into butterflies, the excited kind."

        "text": "Gina looks around her new bedroom. Her family bought this old hotel last week. She\u0027s still getting used to living here. The sun is rising, and Gina pulls the covers over her head. On her dresser, there\u0027s a porcelain doll in the shape of a fox. It\u0027s musical. It plays \"Peter and the Wolf\" when you wind a key in the back. It came with the hotel. Gina dresses herself in jeans and her favorite sweatshirt. The hotel is quiet. Father is already out back. He\u0027s working on fixing the hotel so that guests can stay there soon. It\u0027s time to head to school. As she leaves, she notices an old bicycle she\u0027s never seen before lying in the driveway. Gina shrugs and figures she\u0027ll get to school quicker this way. She puts her schoolbooks in the basket and hops on. The hill is steep and rocky. Her bicycle quickly starts wavering. The front tire is moving back and forth. Suddenly, the bike veers off the road. It\u0027s as if someone else is steering the bike. And then, a tumble! Back tire over front tire, her books fly up in the air. Everything goes flying. Thud! Her English book hits her right on top of the head. Thud! Thud! Down comes Math and then Biology. (Thankfully, those last two are softcover books!) \"Wooooahhh ohhhhh,\" she cries, her eyes rolling back up into her head. Everything gets dark and dizzy and feels like she\u0027s spinning around on a carousel. Perhaps she is. Gina lies down in the grass and falls asleep for a while. It\u0027s starting to get dark when she lifts her head. The book that hit her on the temple is now lying below her like a pillow. She reads the title: The Curious Situation of Foxes. That\u0027s funny, Gina thinks. I don\u0027t remember taking this book out of the library. She\u0027s surely missed school now, and the bicycle is nowhere to be seen. Must be lying in a heap in the brambles. She stands and looks around, dusting off her jeans. There\u0027s a big hole in the sleeve of her favorite sweatshirt! She\u0027s far behind the hotel, surrounded by blackberry bushes. There\u0027s a stone wall covered in moss and a heavy green door with a copper handle in the shape of a fox. She touches the fox head, and the door opens. She walks through the door and sees the front of the hotel. And there\u0027s the bicycle! But this can\u0027t be the entrance to the hotel, can it? She peers down along hallway. It\u0027s longer than she remembers. Her head still hurts from being hit so hard. In her hand, she carries the book that attacked her from the air. She touches her forehead and winces. \"Ugh, I\u0027ve got a lump on my head like a horn!\" At the end of the hallway is a room she has never seen before. She hears laughter and clinking glasses, and sees the flicker of a roaring fireplace. In a strange room with oak walls and tapestries, three people are playing a board game. One man is wearing a tweed jacket and a monocle. One woman has a feather in her hair. The other woman wears a long string of pearls around her neck. They look like ghosts. They drink champagne and white tea, and pass around cherries on a silver platter. \"Hello, my dear,\" says the woman in the necklace of pearls. \"Join our party. Don\u0027t look so scared.\" \"Who are you, and how did you get into the hotel?\" Gina asks. \"I am Marilyn,\" she says. \"And the young woman with the feather in her hair is Melinda. We have always lived here.\" \"Festive outfit!\" Melinda quips. Marilyn takes Gina by the hand and leads her to a chair. Now, Gina sees that her clothes have changed. She is no longer wearing the jeans and sweatshirt she put on earlier. She is wearing a red and green party dress with a black velvet bow in her hair. \"And finally, our guest is in matching holiday attire!\" jokes Melinda. The man stands and introduces himself. He places one hand in front of his stomach and bows. \"Madame Gina, allow me to introduce myself. I am the fox hunter known as Gerard.\" \"Look here, Mr. Fox Hunter,\" Gina says. \"We do not hunt or hurt foxes in my family!\" \"I don\u0027t hurt them! I stuff them and hang them on my wall as art!\" he bellows. \"The foxes are Before Gina can scold him for this terrible comment, the old, oak library shelf begins to stir. \"What moves behind the leather-bound almanac?\" asks the Fox Hunter. The almanac begins to quiver. Gina moves closer to the bookcase to inspect the fluttering. At this moment, the book pops out of the shelf like a toy on a spring! And what appears in its place? None other than a fox! The fox will not remain still, however. He is wriggling himself free. Frantic movements: a hard bearing-down on his front paws, and an occasional grunting. Suddenly, the fox comes flying out of the hole and shoots like an arrow across the room. He lands on a bearskin rug and falls into a deep sleep. Another fox appears! The animals plug the round hole perfectly, like a soft, red cork! \"But how can this be?\" Gina rubs her eyes with her fist. \"From a library shelf?\" When that fox jumps out, yet another fox appears. And again. Faster and faster. The hole becomes a momentous blur of orange and brown. Foxes are bubbling forth in a stream, like a faucet that won\u0027t turn off. All of them landing on the rug in a pile. \"The hole,\" Marilyn gasps. \"It\u0027s a portal! A portal to foxes!\" Although you may imagine our group to be in the midst of a commotion, the foxes are actually quite docile. First, they jump from the hole and run around the room. Quickly, though, their eyes close gently, and they settle down as if for a long winter\u0027s nap. The floor, however, is now nowhere to be seen. Foxes are sleeping and snoring everywhere, without any regard for manners. \"Help! Help!\" cries Melinda. She is trapped beneath a fuzzy pile of small, baby foxes sleeping all around her shoulders and head. \"Tragedy! What can we do?\" they cry. Just now, Gina remembers the book in her hand: The Curious Situation of Foxes. She opens to the first page and begins to read: \"Chapter One: In Case Of Emergency. What to do when a fox portal is opened.\" Melinda throws her arms in the air. \"MRRPHN!\" She pulls a sleeping baby fox out of her mouth. \"Read it!\" \"Well, it says here,\" Gina reads, \"that the un-foxing spell must be chanted in unison. Now, everyone, try your best to grab each other\u0027s hand!\" \"I can\u0027t reach Marilyn cries. \"Yes, you can!\" says the Fox Hunter. He begins swimming around the room. He does the backstroke through foxes, gathering Marilyn and Melinda in each arm. Marilyn\u0027s dainty fingers wrap around Gina\u0027s hand. They chant. \"Foxes of Nature, we beg for your forgiveness and beseech thee to return to the forest. This hotel is not where you should hibernate!\" There is a lightning crash outside and all the windows rattle. And then, backwards, the way they came, the foxes are sucked back into the portal. One by one, tails first and heads last. They are sucked back into the hole, still sleeping soundly, to return to only the devil knows where. When the last fox disappears, the book in Gina\u0027s hand begins to flutter. It\u0027s being pulled uncontrollany toward the portal now. She cannot control her arm, if she doesn\u0027t let go, she\u0027ll go flying across the room. And she does! \"Let go of the book!\" Gina hears a voice cry. And she does that, too. The force pulling her is released and her body stops mid-air. She falls to the floor with a thud. Just like the foxes, she falls asleep. \"Gina, let go of the book,\" she hears. She opens her eyes, and her mother and father are standing above her. She\u0027s back in the bramble, the bicycle a twisted mess beside her. \"Let go of the book, Gina. We\u0027re going to take you inside and clean up all these scrapes and bruises. \"What happened?\" \"You\u0027ve fallen off this bike, dear. And it\u0027s no wonder; it had a completely rusted chain! Now, let go of the book.\" She is clutching a book to her chest. The cover reads: The Curious Situation of Boxes: How to Buiia a Baxfar Any Occasion. \"What are you doing with this strange book, anyway? Planning to make a box?\" \"I... don\u0027t really remember,\" Gina says, rubbing a painful lump on her forehead. \"Oh, will you look at that!\" her mother says, pointing at the woods. \"How sweet!\" On the dirt path behind her, a family of foxes is making their way into the woods. Gina squints and swears she sees Marilyn and Melinda, dressed in feathers and fineries, leading them home. "

        "text": "Jordan loves to use clues to solve riddles. That\u0027s why she loves treasure hunts. She always dreams about being a pirate who is searching for a big treasure chest. She climbs trees and digs holes in her backyard, pretending that she is on a treasure hunt. Jordan\u0027s birthday is soon. Her friends Cameron and Annie decide to create a treasure hunt as her birthday present. They ask their parents what they can do. \"Well, first, you would need to make a map!\" says Cameron\u0027s mom. \"How do we do that?\" Cameron asks. His mom pulls out a piece of paper and several crayons. \"First, you need to draw the place where you will hide the treasure,\" she says. \"How about you draw our backyard?\" Cameron pulls out a black crayon and starts to draw. He marks the spot where the porch is, and he draws a black circle to show where his trampoline sits. His mom pulls out a green crayon and draws the big trees that surround their backyard. \"See? There are plenty of places to hide a treasure,\" she tells him. The next day, Cameron shows Annie the map. She thinks that it looks just like his backyard. \"It\u0027s perfect!\" she says, excited. \"Now, we just need to mark the places where we will hide the clues and then the treasure,\" Cameron says, looking around his backyard. Annie walks over to the trampoline. She gets down on her hands and knees and finds a big rock. \"We can hide a clue under here!\" she shouts to Cameron. Cameron nods his head in agreement. He points to the porch and then to a big tree near the trampoline. \"We can also put clues near those spots!\" he says. His mom comes outside and sees them planning the treasure hunt. \"Don\u0027t forget to draw the bird fountain on the map,\" she says. \"You can draw the fountain with a blue crayon so that Jordan will know that it\u0027s filled with water.\" Cameron and Annie run to get the map. \"We can also add the rock by the trampoline so that Jordan can find the clue,\" Annie says. \"And we should draw the tree by the porch Cameron adds. They put more on the map, and when they finish, their drawing includes everything in Cameron\u0027s backyard. They map all the shapes and kinds of land and water in the area. After they hide all the clues (ten in total), Cameron and Annie think about the treasure. \"It should be a chest full of candy!\" Annie says. \"That\u0027s cool! But we could also fill a chest with pirate stuff like a compass and a pirate hat, and even a message in a bottle!\" says Cameron. They finally decide to do both. Their parents help them find a small chest, and they fill it with pirate things and candy. They dig a hole near a tree and bury the chest. The next day, Jordan comes to Cameron\u0027s house for her birthday. Many of their friends come as well. After they cut the cake, Cameron and Annie tell Jordan that they have a surprise for her. They give her the first clue. \"This is so exciting! Thank you so much, guys Jordan exclaims. She sets out to find her treasure, with the map in hand. "

        "text": "\"I don\u0027t like ponies!\" said Stacey. \"Too had,\" said Jane. \"It\u0027s my house.\" Stacey looked at her friend. Jane was wearing a hat with a pony on it. Her shoes had ponies on them. So did her shirt, and her bracelet, and her pants. She was even wearing a ponytail. On the walls of her bedroom were posters of ponies. Her notebook was covered in pictures of ponies. All of her stuffed animals were ponies, except for one that was just a horse. She was a pony girl. Stacey was not a pony girl. She thought horses were just okay. Sometimes, she liked to play Jane\u0027s games. They would make up names for different ponies. Names like Windcatcher, or Starfire. Sometimes, they would pretend to be ponies. They would run around and make pony noises and play pony games. Other times, they would pretend to ride ponies. \"Whee!\" Jane would shout. \"I\u0027m riding a pony!\" After a while, though, Stacey would get tired of ponies. There were so many other games to play. They could play school. They could play house. They could even play pirates. But whenever her mother took her to Jane\u0027s house, it was only ponies. All the time. Today, Stacey said no. \"I don\u0027t care,\" she said. \"I want to play something different.\" \"Like what?\" said lane. \"What about pirates?\" \"Pirates is a game for boys.\" \"Then what about house?\" \"House is boring,\" said Jane. \"You know what isn\u0027t boring?\" \"What?\" said Stacey. \"Ponies.\" Stacey sat down. She dug her fingers into the dirt, and pulled up a thick clump of grass. She tried to think of a way to make them both happy. \"I have an idea,\" said Jane. \"What?\" said Stacey. \"We could play unicorns.\" \"Unicorns are the same as ponies!\" \"They are not,\" said lane. \"Ponies don\u0027t have a horn. Unicorns have one horn.\" Stacey thought that Jane was difficult. That\u0027s what Stacey\u0027s mother said whenever she had to get her way, no matter what. \"What we need,\" said Stacey, \"is a com promise.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" said Jane. \"A compromise is where you get a little of what you want, and I get a little of what I want. And then we\u0027re both happy.\" lane did not like the sound of this. \"I promise it will work,\" said Stacey. \"Okaaaaaaaaaay,\" said Jane. \"What is your idea for this compromise?\" \"We play school,\" said Stacey. She saw Jane start to get mad. \"But it isn\u0027t an ordinary school!\" \"Why not?\" \"It\u0027s pony school.\" This made Jane smile. \"Am I a pony?\" asked Jane. \"Yes.\" \"And you\u0027re a teacher?\" \"Yes.\" \"But not a pony?\" \"I\u0027m not a pony.\" Jane thought for a minute. She thought hard. Finally, she stood up. She made her pony face. \"Are we ready to begin the lesson ?\" asked Stacey. \"Whinny\" said Jane. They played pony school all day. "

After stepping off the bus and trudging home, she plopped onto her chair in the kitchen. \"What\u0027s up Mia?\" Mr. Murphy asked. He was making Mia her favorite after-school snack, a grilled cheese sandwich. \"This project is taking me forever!\" Mia replied. \"I have to design a website page for my computer class.\" \"Wow, fancy!\" Mrs. Murphy shouted from the living room. \"When we were in middle school, we didn\u0027t even know how to use computers.\" She walked into the kitchen and sat down next to Mia. She asked her daughter if she had anyone to help her with her project. \"We have partners, mine is named Ali,\" she explained. \"Today we learned how to insert pictures into our page!\" Mr. and Mrs. Murphy looked at each other and smiled. Mia noticed their little exchange. \"What?\" she asked, wondering what they were thinking. \"Well, we first met when we were working on a project together in high school,\" Mr. Murphy explained. \"We were assigned to do a research project on American Indian history.\" Mrs. Murphy chimed in. \"But we didn\u0027t have computers back then, so we had to go to the library every day to do research!\" She explained that they didn\u0027t have online search engines to help them with their work; they could only rely on books. They didn\u0027t have cell phones to text each other when they needed help, they had to work together at each other\u0027s houses. \"But that sounds so hard!\" Mia said. \"I can\u0027t imagine completing a project without the help of a computer.\" Mr. Murphy chuckled. \"I know. But I have that project to thank for meeting your mom! All those countless hours in the library...we had to spend a lot of time together,\" he said. Now Mia was curious. She wondered what else was different when her parents were growing up. So she asked. Mrs. Murphy started to list off things she didn\u0027t have as a child, like an mp3 player and a flat- screen television. \"Also, since I had many brothers and sisters, we had to pitch in more. I helped my mom cook dinner, and we repaired our clothes ourselves when they tore,\" she said, tapping Mia on the nose. \"How about you help me cook dinner tonight then?\" Mrs. Murphy suggested, laughing. \"Sure!\" Mia exclaimed. \"How about something that you used to make as a kid?\" \"Chicken noodle soup it is,\" Mrs. Murphy said with a smile.

        "text": "Take a look around. What do you see? All of the objects that surround you - a book, a plant, a pen, a door and even your own body - can only be seen thanks to light. Light is a type of energy that helps us see the world we live in. When it\u0027s completely dark, it is impossible to see anything. Light comes from different places. The sun, stars, lightning and fire all give off light. So do light bulbs, flashlights and candles. Most living things need light in order to survive. Some objects produce their own light, but most do not. The walls in the room you are in do not give off their own light. The light coming down from the ceiling lights above your head bounces right off the walls. If it didn\u0027t, we would not be able to see the walls at all. How do we see things? When light from any source bounces off an object and into our eyes, we are able to see that object. Take a look at your pencil. You can see the pencil because light is bouncing off it and entering your eyes. This \"bouncing off\" is called \"reflection.\" Transparent, or see-through, objects let the light pass right through them. Light can shine through glass and clear plastic. It can also move through water and air. When light travels, it travels in a straight line. Some objects block the light, like trees, buildings, and even you! When an object blocks the light, light cannot pass through to the other side. This is how shadows are made. When the sun shines on a tree, it cannot shine right through the tree. The tree blocks the light beams. On the other side of the tree, you will see a dark spot that is shaped like the tree. That is its shadow, the place where the sun cannot reach. Try standing in front of a wall that is all lit up by a flashlight. Your body does not allow light to pass through it, so it will create a shadow on the wall. You can use all kinds of objects to block the light and make shadows. Try forks and spoons from your kitchen, your shoes or a stuffed animal. Try moving your body or one of these objects around to change the shape of the shadow! The closer the object moves to the flashlight, the bigger and fuzzier its shadow will be. The further the object moves away from the flashlight, the smaller and sharper its shadow will be. Using a mirror, you can take light from one place and make it travel to another. Point your flashlight at the mirror. Now tilt the mirror. By moving the mirror around, you can make the light beam bounce off its shiny surface and fall on different objects in the room. Have you ever wondered why you can see your own face in a mirror? Light shines on your face, then bounces off it and hits the mirror you are looking into. Then, the light bounces, or reflects, off the mirror and right into your eyes. Light bounces around! If it didn\u0027t, we\u0027d be left in the dark. "

        "text": "The alarm went off again. Jonas knew what to do this time. They all had to go out in the hall, sit next to each other, and curl up into a ball. This was in case there was a tornado. Jonas hadn\u0027t understood how in the world going into the hall and curling up into a ball would help you if you got hit by a tornado. Then his teacher had told him that they went into the hall to be away from windows that might break during a tornado. Curling up was in case something fell on you. That\u0027s why they put their hands over their neck, to protect it in case something sharp fell. Molly had just joined the class, and she sat next to Jonas. When the alarm went off, Molly hid under her desk. Jonas had to tell her to get out from under there and follow the class in the hall. It turned out to be a drill, just like last time. After a few minutes, all the students went back into their classroom and sat back down at their desks. After school, Jonas teased Molly about hiding under her desk when the alarm went off. \"Scaredy cat!\" he said. Molly laughed at him. \"I wasn\u0027t scared,\" she replied. Molly explained. She had moved to Oklahoma from California last week. In school in California, when the alarm went off, it was an earthquake drill, not a tornado drill. During the earthquake drill, you were supposed to hide under your desk. Kanisha overheard them. She told them she had just visited her cousins in Florida, and there they are more likely to face a hurricane instead of a tornado or an earthquake. One time the weather forecaster on the nightly news said that a hurricane had formed near Florida, and that the hurricane would probably impact the area. So school was closed completely the next day. There are other storms that can be predicted at least a day before they hit, and schools might close if severe weather were likely to impact the areas near the schools. Jonas had cousins in Minnesota. They told him that they had had three days in a row with no school because it wouldn\u0027t stop snowing, but they had known about the snowstorm from a prediction by the weather forecaster the day before it started to snow. \"Any storm is scary, but I think earthquakes and tornadoes are the scariest,\" Molly said. \"The weather forecaster can probably tell you if a hurricane or snowstorm will come. With earthquakes and tornadoes, you never know.\" "

        "text": "No matter how many times Bobby rode the chairlift, he always got frightened when he looked down. If he stared down long enough to get that tingly feeling, he\u0027d grip the bar in front of him, take stock of the bar between his two legs, and reassure himself that he was secure. Conversation helped distract him. He loved meeting people from all over the country, and even the world, on the chairlift. Games helped distract him, too. \"I spy in my little eye, something...orange,\" Bobby challenged. \"The plastic fence down there,\" guessed Dad. Nope!\"The square with the number on that pole,\" Dad said, pointing to one of the big poles holding up the chairlift. \"Nope \"T he stripe on that guy\u0027s jacket in front of us.\" \"Nope \"Um...the sunshine?\" \"No way. The sun looks more yellow than orange right now, Dad.\" \"Okay, fine. I give up!\" Dad said, throwing his head back in defeat. \"The writing on the band of your goggles!\" \"Tricky, tricky. I\u0027ll stump you next time.\" Bobby loved winning, but he was no longer focused on playing \"I Spy.\" Theyr were close to the top. \"Ready?\" Dad asked. \"Ready,\" Bobby replied, removing his hands from the bar and skis from the little footrests connected to the bar between his legs. Dad pulled the bar up and over their heads, and they looked forward. Skis straight and poles held tightly, they pushed themselves away from the seat and down the small hill their skis touched at the top. This was Bobby\u0027s second time skiing, and he was getting the hang of it. During his first time skiing, Dad taught him how to do the \"pizza,\" skiing with his skis in a wedge like a slice of pizza. Bobby had advanced since then and could now do the \"french fries,\" skiing with his skis parallel and straight like two french fries side by side. When he felt himself going too fast, he would point his skis to the side instead of down the mountain. That would help bring him to a stop. Normally, Bobby staved far away from the forest, while avoiding big groups of people and ice. Luckily, there was a lot of powdery Colorado snow on this mountain and definitely not as much ice as there was on the mountain he had skied in New England. \"Want to try skiing the glades?\" Dad asked when they had stopped for a rest mid-trail. Dad nodded to where a path veered off the trail and into the woods. Bobby saw a few skiers follow the path into the trees. About 10 seconds later, they popped out a little ways down the trail. Bobby felt nervous and excited. \"Let\u0027s do it!\" he said with a grin. \"Okay, you go, and I\u0027ll be right behind you. Don\u0027t go too fast. Keep your eyes on the trail, and try to stay focused and relaxed.\" I.\" \"Here we go Bobby hollered as he glided to the side of the trail, his skis falling in line with a path on the left that gradually curved into the woods. There were trees on either side of Bobby, and the narrow path dipped down and then up a bit, down and then up. It felt like a water-slide but better, because he was in control. There was one last bump on the path, where it exited the woods. When Bobby got to it, he had gained some speed and even got a few inches of air. He wobbled for a second, but quickly regained his balance. \"Awesome!\" he thought. They were near the bottom of the hill, and the lifts were about to close. \"Up for one more run?\" Dad asked. I.\" \"No time for talking Bobby said, hurrying back to the chairlift. "

        "text": "\"Can anyone tell me where Davy is?\" Miss Mastiff asks. \"I saw Davy last night,\" says Lolly. \"My family went to his house for dinner.\" \"But today his seat is empty. Marcos, maybe you know where your twin brother is. Can you tell the class where Davy is?\" \"Certainly, Miss Mastiff. Easy as pie,\" says Marcos. \"Davy is here in class.\" The classroom bursts into laughter. \"We can all see Davy\u0027s seat is empty, Marcos. Davy must be absent.\" \"You may be right, Miss Mastiff,\" says Marcos. \"But maybe not.\" \"How odd,\" says Miss Mastiff, but she begins the lesson anyway. The class has a math exam at the end of the week, and there is a lot of material to review. Later in the lesson, Miss Mastiff asks, \"If there are twenty-seven students and twenty-eight chairs in a classroom, how many chairs are there for every student? Marcos, since you\u0027re so good at math, would you please answer?\" \"Certainly! Easy as pie. Every student has one chair. Sure as my name\u0027s Marcos!\" \"You may be right,\" Miss Mastiff smiles. \"But maybe not.\" It\u0027s recess. Marcos walks by Ella who is talking with Miss Mastiff. Ella says, \"Say Marcos, where\u0027s your brother really? I know he isn\u0027t playing hooky because Davy never lies. Is he sick?\" \"No sicker than you, Ella. No sicker than Miss Mastiff, either.\" \"But I am sick,\" Miss Mastiff says. \"I\u0027ve had a terrible cold for weeks. Can\u0027t you hear how hoarse my voice is?\" \"Oh, that\u0027s right,\" says Marcos. \"I forgot. Isn\u0027t it odd the way you can forget a thing like that? When something has been odd for long enough, it starts to seem ordinary. On the other hand, something can be completely ordinary, and everyone thinks it\u0027s totally odd!\"Marcos laughs and runs off after Lolly. \"I\u0027d say there is something odd going on !\" says Ella. \"Wouldn\u0027t you say so, Miss Mastiff?\" \"Odd indeed, Ella. Sure as my name\u0027s Miss Mastiff!\" Miss Mastiff sneezes. \"Next, we\u0027ll practice a word problem,\" says Miss Mastiff, later that afternoon. She passes out a photocopied sheet of paper. \"Lolly, would you please read it aloud?\" Lolly reads: \"Papa has cut the pie so that everyone will get an even-sized slice. There are four members of Papa\u0027s family, and five members of the family Papa invited over. But before dinnertime, the two naughty brothers steal the pie and split the whole thing between them. How many slices do the two brothers each eat?\" \"Marcos, since you\u0027re so good at math,\" says Miss Mastiff, \"maybe you\u0027d like to show the class how to solve the problem.\" \"Certainly. Easy as pie! Four members of my family plus five members of Lolly\u0027s family means nine people altogether, nine slices of pie. Now, nine slices of pie between my brother and me means we each get...Uh...We each get...\" Marcos\u0027 face turns red. \"You see,\" says Miss Mastiff,\" nine is an odd number and so it cannot be evenly divided between two people. One of the brothers must have had four slices of pie, while the other one had five. The one who ate five is sick. Perhaps that is why he is absent from class.\" \"You\u0027re wrong!\" shouts Marcos. \"Davy only ate four slices.\" \"Precisely!\" says Ella. \"Marcos ate five slices. Marcos is absent. You\u0027ve been tricking us all along! You\u0027re Davy. Marcos is good at math. He must\u0027ve known that nine divided by two is four and one half. He let you think it was four, so that he could eat five slices. Davy, you\u0027re not so good at math, but you\u0027re always honest. You said, \u0027Davy is in class,\u0027 and \u0027Davy isn\u0027t sick.\u0027 You never once lied. That\u0027s how I knew it was you.\" \"It\u0027s true!\" cries Davy. \"It\u0027s all true! If I had only been better at fractions, Marcos and I would have eaten the same amount, and poor Marcos wouldn\u0027t be sick. It\u0027s my fault Marcos is absent. If only I had been better with fractions! Oh, Miss Mastiff! I promise to study for the test!\" \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll do just fine,\" says Miss Mastiff. \"Just remember: Fractions are as easy as pie.\" "

        "author": "W.M.Akers",
        "metadata": "Grade: 3 Lexile: 850L",
        "text": "Roger is new in town, and it has been hard to make friends. The kids at school are nice, but Roger is shy. His birthday is coming up soon. He is planning a big party. It will be a lot of fun. There will be cake, and ice cream, and a treasure hunt. But what if none of the other kids want to come? One week before his party, Roger and his dad go to their favorite restaurant. Benny\u0027s Pizza Parlor makes the best pizza in town. Roger orders a large pie with four kinds of cheese and extra pepperoni. He loves every bite. When he is finished, Roger and his dad go to the kitchen to talk to Benny. \"How was the pie?\" Benny asks. \"It was an ooey-gooey mess!\" says Roger. \"That means I liked it.\" \"Thank you!\" says Benny. Suddenly, Roger gets a great idea. \"Benny,\" he says. \"Will you cook pizza for my birthday party?\" \"Hold on, Roger,\" says Roger\u0027s dad. \"Benny is very busy. He might not have time to make pizza for your party.\" \"But everyone loves his pizza!\" savs Roger. \"If we have it, I\u0027ll be the most popular boy in school.\" \"I know what to do,\" says Benny. \"I won\u0027t cook pizza for your party. Instead, I\u0027ll show you how to make it yourself!\" That week, Roger goes to Benny\u0027s Pizza Parlor every day after school. Benny shows him how to combine flour and yeast and water into a dough. Then, after the dough has had time to sit, they pound it down and roll it as flat as a quarter. The most exciting part is when they get to throw the dough up into the air. When Benny throws the dough, it looks easy. But Roger is afraid to try. \"Don\u0027t worry!\" says Benny. \"If you drop it, we can make more.\" But Roger doesn\u0027t drop it. He throws the dough way up into the air. It spins around like a top. Before it hits the counter, Roger catches it on his knuckles, just like Benny showed him. Next, they talk about toppings. Making cheese pizza is easy. You just choose all the cheese you want and sprinkle it on the dough. Then there is Roger\u0027s favorite: pepperoni. That\u0027s not hard either. Benny slices the pepperoni and lays it on top of the cheese. After that, it starts to get complicated. There is a meat lover\u0027s pizza. There is Hawaiian, with ham and pineapple. There is even anchovy pizza, which Roger does not want to try. \"Come on,\" says Benny. \"Have a bite. It\u0027s good.\" Roger takes a tiny bite. The anchovies taste like cat food. He makes a face, and says, \"I think I\u0027ll stick to pepperoni for now.\" They sprinkle the cheese on the dough. On top of the cheese, they put pepperoni, lots and lots of it. When Benny takes the pizza out of the oven, it is an ooey-gooey mess. It is also the best pizza Roger has ever tasted. Very nice,\" says Benny. \"I could not have done it better myself.\" Roger tells the kids at school that his party will have pizza from Benny\u0027 s. Everyone is excited. Everyone loves Benny\u0027 s pizza. But when they come to his house, Benny isn\u0027t there. Instead, they see Roger, wearing an apron and a chef\u0027s hat. The kids don\u0027t believe that Roger knows how to make pizza. He\u0027s ready to prove them wrong. Roger pounds down the dough, rolls it out, and throws it up into the air. \"Wow!\" they say. \"You lookjust like Ben ny.\" Roger makes them his favorite pie, with four kinds of cheese, and extra pepperoni. Everyone agrees the pizza tastes just like Benny\u0027s. It might even be just a little bit better. "

        "author": "",
        "metadata": "Grade: 3 Lexile: 570L",
        "text": "Buttons the cat is flying through the air. She cannot fly on her own, of course. After all, she is a cat, not a bird. But here she is, flying in the clouds. Buttons is hanging on tight to a wing of an airplane, with a blue glove in her mouth. This glove is her favorite thing in the whole world. It\u0027s why she is on the airplane. Inside the plane, a pretty woman in a red hat waves at Buttons and smiles. How did Buttons get on the airplane? Where is she going, and why? Well, it all started about a year ago. Buttons was walking along in a very nice alley, searching the trash for food. Quite suddenly, she was caught up in a net and put into a box with holes. These kidnappers took Buttons to a shelter and locked her in a cage with food, water, and toys. Buttons was there for a very long time. People would come and go. They would peer into her cage and smile. Buttons did not want to be kidnapped again, so she would hiss at them. People would shake their heads and walk away. This happened day after day, and Buttons felt safe inside the cage. One day, a woman named Maggie came to the shelter. She wore a red hat and a red sweater with a cat on it. She had bright blue gloves, and she put her face right up to the bars. \"Hello, kitty cat!\" Maggie said. Maggie didn\u0027t seem scared. She chuckled and took off her blue gloves. \"Poor kitty,\" she said. But all Buttons saw were those gloves. So blue. So soft. Yes, Buttons wanted those gloves, so she took one. And that is how Buttons came to live in the house of a human named Maggie. Maggie came and went, and she never asked Buttons for anything. She always left fresh food and toys. And one day, she left her blue gloves on the kitchen table. \"I\u0027m going on vacation,\" Maggie told Buttons, kissing the top of her head. \"I\u0027ll see you when I get home!\" The kiss was nice, but all Buttons saw were gloves. As soon as Maggie shut the door, Buttons was on the move! She grabbed one of the gloves in her mouth and held it there! She threw it up in the air and caught it again in her paw. This became a game. Up went the glove, and up went Buttons. Down went the glove, and down went Buttons. Finally, the glove went up and landed on a windowsill. Buttons went up onto the windowsill. Crash! The window opened right up. The glove went tumbling out, caught by a strong gust of wind. Buttons leapt into the air but the glove was always one step in front of her. Behind her, the house was getting smaller and smaller. All she saw was the glove. Blue glove. Must get that blue glove, Buttons thought. Buttons always stopped and looked both ways before crossing the street. The glove, being a glove, didn\u0027t know how to stay safe. The glove ran into the street, right in front of a bus. The bus stopped at a red light, and that was where she caught it. The doors opened, and the bus driver tipped his hat. \"Do you have a bus ticket?\" he asked. Buttons did not have a bus ticket because cats normally do not ride the bus. \"Get out, freeloader!\" he said as the bus screeched off. The bus drove away so fast the blue glove went flying off the bus. Buttons jumped into the air to catch it in her mouth, but just as she did... WHOOSH! A strong gust of wind opened the glove up like a balloon. Buttons was holding on with her teeth, but she was no match for this wind. Up into the sky they went! That\u0027s when a flock of geese flying south for the winter saw the beautiful blue glove starting to fall. \"Is that a flying cat?\" one of the geese asked. \"I think it is,\" the other goose replied. \"And such a pretty color blue on that glove.\" \"A cat cannot flv very far like that,\" the first goose said. \"Indeed. Let\u0027s help her.\" And so the geese decided to help Buttons fly. Thev lifted her onto their wings and flew her up, up, and away into the clouds until they reached an airplane. The geese set Buttons down on one of the airplane\u0027s wings. \"You\u0027re welcome!\" they said, in a huff. \"This rude cat didn\u0027t even thank us!\" Inside the plane, Maggie was on her way to visit her mother. At this moment, she remembered she forgot her favorite gloves on the table! She looked out the window and saw the glove. Then she saw Buttons. Buttons looked in the window and waved at Maggie. Thanks to the pretty blue glove, they were going on an adventure together! "

        "text": "\"Those aren\u0027t the rules!\" said Mario. \"This is my house! I\u0027ll tell you what the rules are!\" said Nicky. The two cousins stared at each other, both refusing to blink. They were warriors about to leap at each other\u0027s throats and settle their argument with violence. The battlefield lay between them, their armies strewn across it. It was not an ordinary battlefield covered with tanks and cannons and soldiers. It was a square, covered in colorful rectangles, some guarded by green and red plastic fortresses. But although the war wasn\u0027t real, the fight between Nicky and Mario was. They were playing Monopoly and prepared to do anything to win. It had started that afternoon when Mario\u0027s mom dropped him off at Nicky\u0027s house. They were cousins, nearly the same age, and had been playing together since they were born. They had played pirates and action figures, video games and tag, and had always had a good time. But whenever they made the mistake of playing Monopoly, the same thing always happened. It started with an argument over who got to be which piece. Obviously, both of them wanted to be the car. \"This is my house,\" Nicky would say. \"I get to be the car.\" \"You were the car last time.\" \"This is my house,\" Nicky would repeat, not quite shouting yet. The shouting would come later. They would argue about who would be the banker and who the realtor. Managing the properties was preferable, of course, because it involved less counting. Counting is never fun. \"I\u0027m the realtor,\" Mario would say. \"No,\" Nicky would reply.\"I called it.\" \"My house.\" \"I called it,\" Mario would repeat, a little bit closer to shouting this time. \"Fine.\" And so, the Monopoly war started quietly, but got a little bit louder after each turn around the board. For the first few rolls, there was little conflict. Mario would buy Vermont Avenue; Nicky would buy St. Charles. But then one of them would get a property the other wanted. \"You can\u0027t buy Connecticut Avenue,\" Mario would say. \"I need that one for my monopoly.\" \"Well I don\u0027t want you to get a monopoly,\" Nicky would say, \"but I\u0027ll sell it to you.\" \"Okay.\" \"Ten thousand dollars.\" \"There aren\u0027t even ten thousand dollars in the game,\" Mario would say, very nearly shouting this time. \"Okay. How about twenty thousand?\" \"No deal.\" No trades would ever be made. The game would stalemate and go on forever, unless one of them got a monopoly by sheer chance. Then the taunting would begin. \"Oh wow,\" Mario would say. \"You have Baltic Avenue, Connecticut, and St. Charles. Those are really great properties.\" \"Oh, so what? So you\u0027ve got all the yellows. Everyone knows the yellows are the worst. Who is a Marvin Gardens, anyway?\" \"I don\u0027t know, but as soon as I get a hotel on him, it\u0027s gonna cost you $1,200 to find out.\" Their voices would get louder. Their sentences would get shorter. Their faces would get red as they counted out each move, slamming their pieces down with greater and greater fury. But they would not yell, no matter who landed on Free Parking, no matter how many hotels were built, no matter what monopolies were acquired. They would not yell...until one of them drew The Card. Every time they landed on Chance, the room grew quiet. They lifted the flimsy red cards slowly, knowing it could be the match that lit the flame. And finally, as it always happened, The Card appeared. \"Take a ride on the Reading Railroad,\" Mario read. \"If you pass Go, collect $200.\" They both looked at the board. Mario\u0027s piece, the hat, the stupid, boring, awful hat, was on the Chance space two spots past Reading Railroad. If he went forward around the board, he would pass Go. He would get $200. He would be able to afford the railroad, one of his favorite properties, and the game would shift in his favor. But he knew Nicky wouldn\u0027t let that happen. Nicky picked up Mario\u0027s piece. \"Put that down,\" Mario said. Nicky moved it back two rectangles and put it on Reading Railroad. \"You know it goes forward,\" said Mario. \"You know it does!\" \"The card doesn\u0027t say anything about that.\" \"The pieces always go forward. Always.\" \"Only on the cards that say \u0027Advance.\u0027 This doesn\u0027t say anything about it, so you take the most direct route. That means you go backwards. That means you don\u0027t get $200. My turn.\" \"Those aren\u0027t the rules!\" \"This is my house! I\u0027ll tell you what the rules are!\" Now they were shouting. Now Mario didn\u0027t care about Reading Railroad anymore. Now all he wanted was to be right. Nicky stood up, sore from so many hours sitting cross-legged. \"Give me the dice,\" he said. \"It\u0027s my turn.\" \"I move forward. I get $200.\" \"Give me the dice!\" Mario dropped the dice on the board, and Nicky bent down to pick them up. Mario bent down too, but he didn\u0027t reach for the dice. Without shouting at all, he slipped one finger under the board and flipped it as high as it would go. Money fluttered down from the ceiling like a very colorful snowstorm, as houses and hotels fell with all the clatter of plastic hail. Nicky opened his mouth like he wanted to scream, but no words came out. \"I don\u0027t think this game works with two people,\" Mario said softly. Nicky nodded. They cleaned up the game together, silently."

        "text": "Power from the Sun and Wind Learn about Earth-friendly energy. What do people need to light their homes and drive cars? Energy! It gives power to many things we need and use. Most of the energy people use comes from coal, oil, and gas. They are called fossil fuels. Those fuels come from fossils under the ground. Fossils are the remains of plants and animals that lived long ago. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air. The air becomes dirty. That can be harmful to people, animals, and plants. Now more people are using clean energy. Such energy does not pollute the air. Two kinds of clean energy are wind power and solar power. Solar means \"from the sun.\" Solar Power. The sun gives Earth heat and light. Some homes have solar panels on the roof. The panels collect sunlight and turn it into electricity. That is a kind of energy. It lets people do many things. For example, we use electricity to light our homes and watch television. Solar power can also be used to warm up the water in our homes. Wind Power. People can turn wind energy into electricity. Wind turbines are machines that spin when the wind blows. They make electricity. Wind turbines are grouped together in wind farms. Some wind farms have hundreds of wind turbines. The Roscoe Wind Farm in Texas has 627 turbines. They can power 230,000 homes."

        "text": "I don\u0027t like to forget my dreams. You know how sometimes you wake up, and you can remember your whole dream perfectly, but by dinner the entire thing is gone? I don\u0027t like that. Where do these dreams go? Why are dreams so easy to forget? Here\u0027s the really strange thing, and maybe this has happened to you: Say you have a dream where you\u0027re riding a bike around the playground of your old school. You wake up, and pretty soon you forget the dream. But then your sister asks if she can borrow your bike, or you drive by your old school. And then it all comes back to you! How does that happen? It\u0027s one big mystery. People have walked on the moon, but they can\u0027t remember what they dreamed about last night! Like I said, I don\u0027t like to forget my dreams. So I started writing my dreams down. As soon as I wake up, I rush over to the computer and start typing as fast as I can. Or I grab a notebook and a pencil. Anything works. What\u0027s important is to get it down before I forget everything. I have some good dreams written down. Last week, I dreamed I was an octopus. I thought I looked normal, but I guess all octopuses think that! I swam around the ocean. I swam through a school of fish. I crept and I crawled. Right before I woke up, I was thinking about how quickly I could write down dreams with eight legs. Have you ever had a dream in which you were flying? I haven\u0027t. But two weeks ago, I had a dream in which everyone except me was flying. That was disappointing. I watched them zoom around. And then I realized that nobody could tell me what to do. They were too high up in the air! I spent the rest of the dream trying to drive my mom\u0027s car. I\u0027m glad I started writing my dreams down. Still, though, I tend to miss some things. Even when I write as fast as I can, I still forget the details. I think the details are the most important part. They\u0027re what make dreams dreamy, don\u0027t you think? For example, when l was an octopus, what did the water taste like? What did my tentacles feel like? What did the fish say to me? I forgot! Writing dreams down is good, but it\u0027s not good enough. From now on, I\u0027m writing my dreams down in advance. What do you think about that? I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s going to work right away. Like with everything, it\u0027ll take some practice. But before long, I expect to have the fullest, best, most detailed dreams anyone\u0027s ever had. And here\u0027s the best part: I\u0027ll be the one picking my dreams! Who picks my dreams now? Who knows. Whoever it is, they\u0027re not going to be in charge for long. I\u0027ll be running the show. I\u0027ll get myself a notebook, a real nice one. In big letters on the front I\u0027ll write: \"Dream Schedule.\" Inside, I\u0027ll have one page for each day. I can plan weeks ahead if I want to. If I\u0027m feeling dreamy, I\u0027ll plan out a whole week at once. Then I won\u0027t have to worry about it. I can\u0027t wait! I already know what my first dream will be. I can see it now: I wake up in the morning, just like normal. It\u0027s Saturday. No school. I sit up in bed and yawn. I stretch my arms. All of a sudden, I realize something\u0027s off: I\u0027m dreaming! "

Most of the energy people use comes from coal, oil, and gas. They are called fossil fuels. Those fuels come from fossils under the ground. Fossils are the remains of plants and animals that lived long ago. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air. The air becomes dirty. That can be harmful to people, animals, and plants. Now more people are using clean energy. Such energy does not pollute the air. Two kinds of clean energy are wind power and solar power. Solar means \"from the sun.\" Solar Power.The sun gives Earth heat and light. Some homes have solar panels on the roof. The panels collect sunlight and turn it into electricity. That is a kind of energy. It lets people do many things. For example, we use electricity to light our homes and watch television. Solar power can also be used to warm up the water in our homes. Wind Power. People can turn wind energy into electricity.Wind turbines are grouped together in wind farms. Some wind farms have hundreds of wind turbines.

        "text": "Did you know that bread is one of the earliest human inventions? Bread is a food made of flour and water. Other ingredients and shape can vary. Scientists have learned that humans have been eating bread in some form or another for 30,000 years. Ancient Egyptians ate a lot of bread. In fact, because they had no potatoes or rice, bread was the most important carbohydrate source in the ancient Egyptian\u0027s diet. Egypt gets little rain. Ancient Egyptian farmers relied on the annual flooding of the Nile River to irrigate their fields. Egyptian farmers paid a portion of their grain harvest to the Egyptian treasury. Archaeologists have discovered illustrations of bakeries and loaves of bread in ancient Egyptian burial sites. Professional bakers and home-bakers used the same production techniques. Home- bakers, usually women, baked only the bread they would need for that day. Egyptians used a grain from emmer wheat for their bread. The grain was ground by hand on a millstone. This process cracked and crushed the grain into coarse flour. The flour was mixed with water and sometimes a little old dough. It was placed in a pot and baked in a clay oven. This Egyptian bread was a flatbread. Indian naan and Middle Eastern pita are two examples of flatbreads eaten today. At the end of the ancient Egyptian period, however, around 300 B.C., Egyptian bakers added to their bread an important ingredient: yeast. Yeast is a microscopic fungus. It makes bread rise. Today bread production is more complicated. Yes, you can still bake your own bread at home with store-bought flour and yeast. You can also buy bread made at small bakeries. But the fluffy bread you see in grocery stores in the United States today is made in large commercial facilities. These commercial facilities, or plants, have business contracts to bake many different bread brands. Most breads today are made using four basic ingredients: flour, yeast, salt, and water. Farmers across the United States grow wheat in large quantities. Half of the wheat produced is used in the United States. The other half is exported to other countries. Grain is processed into flour by companies which then sell the flour to commercial bakeries. These bakeries produce the dough and bake the bread, then package it and arrange for its distribution to stores. "

        "text": "On May 24, 1869, 10 men left Green River Station, Wyoming Territory, for uncharted waters. The men were a tough bunch. They considered themselves adventurers, fighters, hunters and guides. Most of them had served in the Civil War. Their leader was a natural historian named John Wesley Powell. Powell had also served in the army. (His right arm was amputated after taking a musket shot at the Battle of Shiloh.) After the war he taught geology at Illinois Wesleyan University. Powell was an explorer and a scientist. He wanted to understand the natural conditions that formed the landscape of the American West. Powell had recruited the nine other men during his explorations in the Rocky Mountains. He needed the men to help him with an important expedition. He was leading the first exploration of the Colorado River. The Colorado River is the largest and most important river of the American West. It starts in the Rocky Mountains and flows south and west across Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and California. In the 19th century it regularly flooded and jumped its banks. On the day of their departure, the 10 men piled their four boats with ammunition, traps, food and scientific instruments. Getting to the Colorado River would take time. They started on the Green River and spent a month exploring the river and its tributaries. They named a canyon Gray Canyon after its gray sandstone walls. Later they entered an area called \"Land of the Standing Rock\" by Native Americans. This area was marked by red rock and many distinctive buttes. On July 16th, Powell\u0027s team arrived at the Colorado River. On August 5th, the men came into a canyon with very high walls. Powell named it Marble Canyon. The rock was hard, and Powell expected to encounter rough rapids. For three days the canyon walls got higher and higher. Powell\u0027s party had entered the Grand Canyon. No one had ever mapped the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. For three days Powell\u0027s expedition floated through the Marble Canyon. On August 8th the team camped in Redwall Cavern. The cavern was a rock overhang that had been cut by the river. Powell wrote in his diary that the cavern could seat 50,000 people. The men pushed on. For weeks they traveled downriver. They rowed when the river became narrow and shallow. They clung for their lives when the river fell into steep rapids. Some days they had no trouble; the river was wide and calm. On those days they climbed the canyon walls to survey the area and collect specimen or supplies. The wind swept across the arid landscape. Sandstone rocks appeared in the shapes of anvils, arches and steeples. On August 29th, they arrived at the Grand Wash. The Powell Geographic Expedition had traveled 277 miles of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. Along the way they lost one boat and much of their food. Four of the men had abandoned the expedition. "

        "author": "W.M. Akers",
        "text": "When Crystal\u0027s father got a new job, he had to shave his beard. Crystal did not mind. Daddy\u0027s beard was scratchy. Daddy\u0027s beard was ugly. It was time for Daddy\u0027s beard to go. She stared as he filled the sink with water. He smeared white suds over his scratchy brown beard. He picked up his razor. He dragged it slowly down his cheeks. In just a few minutes, his face was clean. He rinsed off and looked at Crystal. \"Wow!\" she said. \"I have a whole new daddy!\" \"Do you like how your new daddy looks?\" She kissed his cheek. It was as smooth as can be. \"I sure do!\" While Daddy was at work, Crystal thought about his shave. She had never seen him do it before, but it came so naturally to him. He knew just what to do, and in the end, he looked perfect. Crystal wanted to shave like Daddy, but she knew that girls didn\u0027t need to shave, especially not eight-year-old girls. And she also knew that if Daddy caught her fooling with his razor, he would not be pleased. But she wanted to know what it felt like to shave. It looked like so much fun! Since she didn\u0027t have a beard, she didn\u0027t need a blade. But she would need something to \"shave\" with. A spoon was the wrong shape. A pencil was too pointy. Her mother\u0027s cell phone looked just like an electric razor, but Crystal knew Mommy didn\u0027t want shaving cream all over it. \"Maybe I can just use my hands!\" Crystal dragged her favorite stool in front of Daddy\u0027s sink. She pulled her hair back. She put on a very serious, fatherly face. She turned on the faucet. The water spilled into the sink, too hot to touch. \"Ow!\" Crystal turned down the heat. She flicked it with her finger until it felt nice to touch. She pulled the stopper, and the sink began to fill. Crystal gripped the can of shaving cream tightly. Just like Daddy had, she squirted it into her hand. Only she pushed a little too hard and her aim wasn\u0027t that good. Shaving cream squirted out in a stream, covering the counter and mirror, and, well, the whole bathroom. \"Oopsie,\" said Crystal. She picked up a glob of the cream and rubbed it onto her face. Putting her serious face back on, she massaged it into her cheeks. She feltjust like a man in a shaving commercial, right until some of it got into her mouth. It tasted like sour goo. \"Yuck!\" she spit it out, but the taste lingered. \"Shaving is gross.\" Once she had a nice frothy beard, she was ready to shave. She crooked her finger and dragged it down her cheek, just like Daddy. She was about to rinse her finger in the sink when she realized she\u0027d made another mistake. She hadn\u0027t turned off the water! Some sinks have a little hole at the top for water to escape into when it gets too full. This sink did not. While Crystal had been getting ready to shave, the bathroom had flooded. There was an inch of water on the floor and more spilling out by the second. Crystal turned off the sink. She rinsed off her face. She backed out of the bathroom on tiptoes. \"Shaving is harder than it looks,\" she said. She wondered what Mom would do when she found the mess. A smile crossed her face. \"Maybe she\u0027ll blame Daddy!\" "

She is only the fourth female U.S. Supreme Court justice in history. This became the first time the Court had three women justices at the same time. Kagan grew up in New York City. She dreamed of being a judge. Her dream started to come true in May 2010. That was when U.S. President Barack Obama picked her to become a justice. Before she could join the Supreme Court of the United States, she had to meet with U.S. senators. They asked her questions. Then they voted on whether she should become a justice. A majority, or most, of the senators agreed she should. In her role, Kagan works with eight other U.S. Supreme Court justices. They interpret, or explain, the U.S. Constitution. That document says how the nation should be run. The justices must decide whether laws follow the Constitution\u0027s rules. The U.S. government isn\u0027t a tree, but it does have branches! Each branch does a different job. Legislative Branch.The U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives make up this branch.Their job is to create laws.Executive Branch The president and vice president are in this branch. The president carries out laws and leads the U.S. military. Judicial Branch.The U.S. Supreme Court runs this branch. Its duty is to make sure laws follow the U.S. Constitution.! "

        "text": "Beeeep beeeep beeeep. Aidan\u0027s alarm clock rang out with a deafening screech. It was 9 am. and much too early for Aidan to be awake on a Saturday. As he lazily sat up and reached for the clock to turn it off, he realized what day it was. His birthday! He rubbed his eyes and stumbled out of bed. The smell of blueberry pancakes hit him as he clambered downstairs, which finally woke him up. \"Happy birthday, Aidan!\" his parents excitedly greeted him as he sat down at the kitchen table. His mom turned around to grab a steaming plate of golden pancakes from the counter and set it in front of him. \"Hold on, they aren\u0027t finished just yet,\" she told him. He thought she was going to get syrup, but she came back holding a bunch of striped candles. \"Candles in pancakes?\" he thought as she pushed 13 candles into the top pancake and lit them with a match. Before his parents could say anything else, he quickly made a wish and blew out all the candles - he didn\u0027t want the wax to melt into his delicious breakfast. \"Thank you he said with his mouth full. His mom and dad laughed as they watched him scarf down the heap of pancakes. \"Well, even though you have plenty planned for tomorrow, I have a surprise for you today,\" his dad said. They had planned his party for Sunday, since that was when his older sister was able to come back home from university. \"Go get dressed. Your surprise will be waiting for you downstairs when you get back,\" he told his son. Aidan rushed upstairs and returned back in five short minutes, with his pant leg still tucked into his sock and a tiny bit of toothpaste at the corner of his mouth. His mother laughed. \"Well, aren\u0027t you excited,\" she said with a smile. On the kitchen table, Aidan noticed a piece of paper neatly folded into a small square. His dad noticed his gaze. \"All right, well, open it up,\" he told him. Aidan picked it up and unfolded it. On it, his dad had written a short note. He read it out loud. \"Just like your favorite literary wizard, this spot is marked by a scar.\" \"You made me a treasure hunt? Aidan asked excitedly. His dad nodded, smiling. He knew Aidan would love it; he was always watching crime movies and reading mystery novels. Aidan started to think. His favorite literary wizard... that would have to be a character in one of his favorite books: Harry Potter. \"Obviously,\" he thought. He fell in love with the series as soon as he started the first book just a couple of years ago. He always secretly identified with the odd boy out who discovered he was a wizard at the young age of 11. After some thinking, he finally remembered the small lightning mark he had carved into a tree in his backyard after finishing the seventh book in the series - the last one. He ran through the fallen red, orange, and brown leaves - Aidan\u0027s favorite thing about fall. There it was: the scar in the clue. He searched around the tree\u0027s base, looking for another piece of paper. He brushed away the leaves and finally found one tucked between two small rocks. He briskly opened it. \"Green is this poet\u0027s color of choice; red is the color of his language; add some white and blue, and you have his flag. Oh, and your mom\u0027s a fan.\" \"This is a tough one,\" thought Aidan. He knew he was searching for a poet. He didn\u0027t know what green meant, so he started with red. He thought, \"Well, red usually signifies love or anger, but a love poet makes more sense. So red, white, and blue are the colors of his or her flag. America?\" He tried to think of some American love poets his mom liked, but he remembered none. After a few minutes, Aidan finally thought of the book on his mother\u0027s nightstand: Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair by Pablo Neruda. \"And he\u0027s from Chile, so red, white, and blue!\" Aidan ran through the back door and up to his parents\u0027 room to find the next clue. He then remembered his mom once mentioned that Neruda used to write with green ink. \"Perfect,\" he thought. The book was right on her nightstand. He opened it and out fell another piece of paper. \"You\u0027re almost there!\" his dad called out from downstairs. Aidan peeled open the clue. \"For this last clue, remember when your sister was blue and couldn\u0027t find her favorite Boo.\" Aidan started to think about the last part, \"her favorite Boo.\" He thought, \"Boo had to be a name, since it was capitalized. Could it be the name of a toy when she was little? No, Melanie only got upset when she lost a book.\" He thought for a while longer. \"That\u0027s it!\" He remembered the time when Melanie lost To Kill a Mockingbird, her favorite book, in which Boo Radley, a mysterious neighbor, rescues the main character from a dangerous fight. She always talked about how the book was an American classic, and Harper Lee, the author, was her idol. He ran outside to the end of his driveway, which is where the book fell out of her backpack one day on her way home from school. He crouched down and looked around for another piece of paper, but there wasn\u0027t one to be found. Aidan was stumped. At last, he looked up, and out of the corner of his eye, he noticed someone watching him from across the street. He stood up and realized it was his sister. \"Surprise!\" she yelled with a huge smile on her face. "

        "text": "On July 4, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was signed, and the Revolutionary War was about to begin. Seven weeks later, on August 22nd, 1776, the British Army invaded New York. The British chose to attack Brooklyn, a village across the East River from Manhattan. General George Washington\u0027s army was located in this village. The Patriot forces were ready to fight, but they were badly outnumbered. The British had about 20,000 soldiers. The Americans had fewer than 13,000. The battle started on August 27th, when British soldiers raided a watermelon patch, and were fired upon by American troops. The Americans retreated northward, fighting as they went. The British surrounded the Americans, who fled across the Gowanus Creek. To keep back the British, they left behind a group of soldiers from Maryland: just a few hundred Americans to hold off 2,000 Redcoats (British Army soldiers). The British were fighting from in front of the Old Stone House, a farmhouse built in 1699. The Marylanders attacked the house six times. Nearly all of them were killed or captured. As he watched from a nearby hill, General Washington said, \"Good God! What brave fellows I must this day lose.\" Because of the sacrifice of the Marylanders, the rest of the American army was able to escape. Had it not been for the fighting at the Old Stone House, the war could have been lost that morning. The Revolution survived, and so did the Old Stone House. The family home of the Vechte family was sold to the Cortelyous in 1783. In the late 19th Century, it served as the clubhouse for the baseball team that would later be named the Brooklyn Dodgers. In 1897, the house was destroyed and buried. Thirty years later, it was dug up and rebuilt by the New York City Parks Department. \"Eighty percent of the house,\" said Old Stone House Executive Director Kimberly Maier, is original material.\" On the outside, the house looks just as it did in 1699. On the inside, there is an exhibit about the Battle of Brooklyn and the men who died there. There are uniforms like the soldiers would have worn, maps of the battle, and a diorama of the fighting around the house. Six thousand children come every year to learn about the house. Maier and her staff teach them not just about the battle, but about what life was like in the 18th century. \"You couldn\u0027t go to the grocery store,\" she said. \"You just had one dress, because you had to weave it and cut the cloth and sew it together. The chores were so much more than just making your bed.\" Maier said that school children are most surprised when they learn what playtime was like in the 18th century. To kids today, 18th century fun looks a lot like work. \"Kids would start out by helping in the garden, or helping to churn butter,\" Maier said. Children would do basic weaving, or help in the kitchen. As they got better at these tasks, they would learn more advanced tasks. Eventually, they would be as good as a grown-up. When they played outside, they didn\u0027t have rubber balls. Instead, they used an inflated pig\u0027s bladder. Outside the Old Stone House is a park. A few years ago, it was rebuilt. It has swings, fountains, and jungle gyms. Children play there every day, and they don\u0027t have to use a butter churn. "

        "author": "",
        "metadata": "Grade: 3 Lexile: 600L",
        "text": "It\u0027s a sunny morning in the one-room apartment, and the girl is sleeping peacefully in her bed. Under the table across the room, someone is not asleep but awake and alert. Apple the Cat has an important mission, but she\u0027s going to need some help. She\u0027s already tried everything she could do on her own, but she\u0027s beginning to realize this mission is not so simple. She will have to call in reinforcements. She tried meows and playful taps of the paw, but nothing could wake the sleeping girl. Apple calls a meeting to order. A few of her trusty friends are in attendance. She has summoned Fur Toy, Feather Stick, Bear Bear, and Shoe. \"We have an important subject to debate,\" says Apple. Bear Bear is grumpy because he doesn\u0027t know what could possibly be important enough to call a meeting to order so early in the morning. \"This couldn\u0027t wait until later?\" he grunts. Apple ignores the cranky bear and continues addressing the crowd. \"I need to wake the human Apple declares. \"Have you tried meowing?\" asks Feather Stick. \"I already tried that,\" says Apple impatiently. \"What about playful taps?\" Feather Stick persists. \"No,\" says Apple. \"Today we need a new plan. Nothing seems to wake her.\" \"I have an idea!\" shouts Fur Toy. He\u0027s new in the room and always trying to prove himself with the others. \"What about walking by her and gently rubbing her with your whiskers?\" he proposes. Shoe ro||s her eyes. \"Something new, Fur Toy,\" she says. \"We all know that\u0027s the oldest trick in the book.\" \"How about you just pounce on her?\" says Bear Bear, growing annoyed. All he wants to do is go back to sleep. The rest shoo him out of the meeting. Everyone knows pouncing is no longer allowed. \"Okay, I\u0027ve got it,\" announces Feather Stick proudly, primping his few feathers. \"It has to be something loud enough, right?\" \"Go on,\" says Apple. \"What about all those new plates she just bought? What if we broke one?\" \"She would be so mad,\" says Apple, dismissing the plan. \"There\u0027s no way we can get away with that. We would be in trouble forever, and anyway, she would probably blame it all on me.\" \"I promise to take some responsibility,\" says Fur Toy, puffing up his chest. \"Not me,\" huffs Bear Bear from across the room. \"Nobody asked you, Bear Bear,\" says Shoe. She begins tying up her laces. \"Wait, Shoe, you think this is a good idea?\" asks Apple. When Shoe ties up her laces, everyone knows she means business. \"I don\u0027t know, it could work,\" she admits. \"Plus, what does she need all those dishes for?\" Apple thinks about it. She doesn\u0027t want to upset the girl, but she really needs to wake her. can\u0027t possibly wait for her to wake up?\" Apple pretends not to hear him, but the others begin to nod in agreement. Only Feather Stick seems unconcerned as he continues to preen his feathers and play in the patches of streaming sunlight from the window. \"Yeah, I mean, what is so important?\" demands Shoe. been days since my last treat! I\u0027m going crazy here. I love those things!\" \"So what do we get out of this?\" asks Fur Toy. \"How does my undying appreciation sound?\" replies Apple. There is some hesitation among the others, but everyone knows Apple is most loved by the human, so it doesn\u0027t take much convincing. \"Now we just need a plan,\" she says. \"Well, I\u0027ve got one,\" interjects Fur Toy. \"If we all climb to the top ofthe counter and jump at the same time, surely that will be enough force to break the top plate!\" Apple is hesitant; she really does not want to upset the girl, but she couldn\u0027t be more desperate for a treat. She finally agrees to the plan. What could go wrong? Plates are replaceable, and surely the girl won\u0027t mind. On the other hand, despite being the most loved, she is also likely to be the first blamed for the mishap. Apple, Shoe, and the toys, with the exclusion of Bear Bear, who watches from afar, climb together to the top of the shelf. \"On my count,\" says Shoe, grumbling something about how she\u0027s too old to be doing this. \"1....2.....3!\" They all jump, but their timing isn\u0027t quite right, and Fur Toy and Feather Stick miss the plate altogether. They hardly make a peep and the plate remains unbroken. \"Let\u0027s try that again with more force and better timing,\" says Fur Toy, blushing a bit. They climb the counter, and Apple takes charge. \"Okay, everyone,\" she says. \"We have to hold onto each other and jump together toward the middle of the top plate. Otherwise, we\u0027ll never make it.\" On the count of three theyjump again, and again nothing happens. \"Wait, wait, wait,\" says Bear Bear from where he\u0027s watching. \"That\u0027s never going to work. You have to shove the darn thing on the floor.\" \"You know, he\u0027s right,\" agrees Shoe, reluctantly. The rest nod in solemn agreement. \"Okay,\" says Apple. \"I can probably handle this one on my own, but I have to know you guys have my back.\" They nod again, furiously. Apple creeps to the top of the shelf and then slowly down to the stack of plates. She presses her nose firmly against the stack and nudges the top plate. With a few more nudges it begins to move. She gives it one final nudge and with a loud crash it smashes into the floor. Feather Stick and Fur Toy jump out of sight. Bear Bear is long gone. Shoe is too shocked to move. The girl leaps out of bed and comes stomping into the kitchen. \"What is going on in here?\" she demands, angrily. Apple can only think of one thing to do in this situation. She rolles onto her back and offers up her soft, patterned underbelly to the girl. She flicks her paws in the air and meows as gently as she can. \"Aww,\" the girl coos. \"How could I ever be mad at you?\" She pulls a bag down from the cabinet and offers Apple a treat. "
