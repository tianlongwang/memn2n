        "text": " What do you hear? You may hear people talking. You may hear a car or the wind or music. Your ears help you hear those sounds. Sound travels in waves. The waves go into your outer ear. That is the part you see. Inside your ear, sound waves go through a tiny tunnel. It is called the ear canal. Those waves hit stretched-out pieces of skin called eardrums. The eard ru ms vibrate. That means they shake back and forth. Your inner ear turns those vibrations into a signal. That signal goes to your brain. The brain understands that the signal is a sound. What is the result? You hear something! "

They look a little like tacks. These tips help you run without slipping. You will need plastic shin guards. Shin guards cover the lower part of your legs. If another player accidentally kicks you, he or she will hit the shin guard instead of your leg. You will need a team shirt. All members of the same team wear shirts of the same color. That helps players find their teammates. Now grab a ball. You are ready to play soccer! "

Some people did not answer their phone calls. Ray came up with a way to send messages from computer to computer. Ray sent the first e-mail in 1971.

Members of the tribe dried the animal skin, turning it into leather. Then the members shaped the leather to cover their feet. Each tribe had its own decorations for moccasins. Some tribes used beads. In other tribes, members painted symbols onto the animal skins. Some moccasins had hard bottoms. They were good for walking on sharp stones or prickly cacti. Moccasins with soft bottoms were best for walking in leaves. "

It is also called a spine. Birds have many hollow bones. Hollow bones have empty space inside. They make a bird\u0027s body lighter. That helps birds fly. Birds are warm-blooded. They make their own body heat. Birds lay eggs. The shells are hard. Birds keep the eggs warm. How? They sit on them until the eggs hatch! Then the bird takes care of its chicks. "

Jackrabbits have long ears. Their ears help them get rid of body heat and stay cool in the desert. Jackrabbits eat twigs and cactus plants. The desert tortoise digs holes, ca||ed burrows, under the ground. Staying in its burrows helps the tortoise keep cool when the desert sun is very hot. Prairie dogs are fast runners. They run quickly from desert enemies such as coyotes and eagles. Prairie dogs call to one another when danger is near. "

The leather was from the skin of a deer or a moose. Members of the tribe dried the animal skin, turning it into leather. Then the members shaped the leather to cover their feet. Each tribe had its own decorations for moccasins. Some tribes used beads. In other tribes, members painted symbols onto the animal skins. Some moccasins had hard bottoms. They were good for walking on sharp stones or prickly cacti. Moccasins with soft bottoms were best for walking in leaves. "

        "text": "Wind is air that moves. When air moves, it blows things from one place to another. Wind blows seeds around. That allows new plants to grow. Think about the dandelion flower. Have you ever seen one that has turned white? Inside it are seeds. When wind blows on a white dandelion, its seeds float away. Some of those seeds will fall on the ground. Soon, something will change in the place where the wind blew the seeds. New dandelion plants will grow there! "

She does it to protect the eggs. Otherwise, raccoons and other predators may eat the eggs. Afterward, the sea turtle mother returns to the sea. Two months later, the eggs hatch. Baby turtles dig out of the sand. They cross the beach to the ocean. In the ocean, the little turtles eat and grow. They may live for more than eighty years. Male sea turtles never return to land. Female sea turtles come back only to lay eggs. Then the cycle of life begins again. "

A caterpillar hatches from the egg. The caterpillar eats leaves and grows bigger. Next, the caterpillar spins a covering around itself. The covering is called a chrysalis (KRIS-a-liss). Inside the chrysalis, the caterpillar slowly changes. The insect\u0027s wings, legs, and antennae begin to form. About two weeks later, a new creature pops out of the chrysalis. It has become a butterfly! The butterfly flutters its wings and flies away. "

The wheelchair will not fall over. Sometimes curb ramps can be dangerous, however. The ramps make the sidewalk level with the street. People who are blind may not know they are on a ramp. They might walk into a busy street. Inventors thought about making a better curb ramp. They added a bumpy plastic covering to existing curb ramps. People who are blind can feel the bumps. Those people will know they are on a ramp. Wheelchairs can safely roll down the ramp too. Now curb ramps help everyone. "
