        "text": "Seat Belts Mean Safety By Linda Ruggieri *wre Seat belts have been keeping people safe in cars for more than fifty years. But cars did not always have seat belts. If a car stops suddenly, people are pushed forward in their seats. In the days before seat belts, more people were thrown out of cars in accidents. People started demanding that car companies do something to protect drivers and passengers. Companies began to develop seat belts. But designing the belts to work well was not a smooth process. The first seat belts only went across a person\u0027s waist. These belts attached to the base of the seat in the car. These new belts held people in their seats. However, many people were still hurt in crashes. New types of seat belts were tried. The best new ones went across a person\u0027s chest and waist. These belts keep a person\u0027s whole body from moving around. As a result, fewer people get hurt in car accidents. Although seat belts helped keep people safe, some people did not want to wear them. Later on, states passed laws that said people must wear seat belts. Today, all cars come with seat belts. Using seat belts makes everyone safer. "

        "text": "Lily wanted to do a project. \"What about making a time line?\" her father asked. \"That is a list of important events in your life.\" \"Sure!\" Lily replied. \"Can you show me how?\" Lily\u0027s dad gave her a piece of paper, a pencil, and a ruler. She held the pencil and used the ruler to draw a straight line. Then her father marked a small line across the longer line at the left end. Above the small line, he wrote, Lily is born. \"Why did you make that small line at the left end, Dad?\" Lily asked. \"On a time line, events are ordered from left to right. The first event is placed on the left end and the last event is placed on the right end.\" Lily then wrote the month, day, and year of her birthday under the first small line. Next, her dad marked another small line to the right of the first small line. He wrote, Lily learns to walk above that line. Then he marked another small line to the right of the second small line. Above this line he wrote, Lily starts school. \"What about when I learned to ride my bike?\" asked Lily. \"Right! We should add that,\" her dad said. \"I want to add pictures,\" Lily told her dad. She made a drawing of herself riding a bike and taped it to the paper. Her dad put a photo of Lily\u0027s first day of school on the time line, too. Now their work was done. Lily said, \"That time line is a picture of my life.\" \"It is a picture of your life sofar,\" her dad added. \"There is a lot more to come!\" "

        "text": "Water comes in three forms: liquid, solid, and gas. Water can be a liquid. It flows. It has no shape of its own. A liquid takes the shape of its container. Water can be a solid. Solids have their own shape. Water in its solid form is called ice. Water can be a gas. Gas has no shape. Water in its gas form is called vapor. You can see liquid water after it changes to a solid. Pour water into a cup. Put the cup into the freezer. The next day, the water will have turned into ice. Ice can change back to liquid water. Observe this: Take ice cubes from the freezer. Put a few of them on a plate. They will melt and turn into liquid water. Heat can change liquid water to a gas. What happens when a pot of water boils? Bubbles begin to form. Then the water starts to evaporate. You can often see the gas escape as water vapor. Water vapor also can turn back into a liquid. That happens when the vapor loses heat. The process of water vapor becoming liquid is called condensation. "

        "text": "\"But I don\u0027t want to go there!\" insisted Billy. He kicked at the ground with his foot, twisted his body around, and looked up at his mother with tears in his eyes. Billy was angry. His mother was a nurse, and she had a new job at a senior center. \"Old-folks home,\" Billy called it. \"Senior Center,\" his mother corrected. Billy didn\u0027t like the seniors. He didn\u0027t like the senior center. He thought it was boring. Billy\u0027s mother wanted Billy to come to the senior center every day after school. Billy wanted to go to see his friends or play video games at home. Billy\u0027s mother wouldn\u0027t let him. \"I don\u0027t have a babysitter for you,\" she said. \"And you can\u0027t go to a friend\u0027s house unsupervised every day.\" The senior center was across the street from Billy\u0027s school. \"Come meet me at the center at 3pm,\" his mother directed. \"You can stay here until my shift ends at 4:30.\" So it was decided. Every day after school Billy said good-bye to his friends and walked over to the senior center. \"Hello, Billy. How was school today?\" asked Curtis, when Billy came in. Curtis was the building\u0027s security guard. \"Hello. Curtis. School was okay,\" Billy said. Every day at the senior center started like that. Billy would then go to the nurse\u0027s station where there was a quiet room. He would do his homework, then sit and stare at the walls. Billy would try to look as bored and as miserable as possible, in the hope someone would notice and convince his mother to let him go home. He would sit and think of his friends, home playing video games. He thought ofthe worlds he could be creating and the monsters he could be slaying. If only he were playing video games, too. Billy\u0027s mother didn\u0027t appreciate any of this. \"You\u0027re being ridiculous,\" she said. \"Why are you acting this way? The senior center isn\u0027t torture. There\u0027s a lot you could do here. I don\u0027t understand why you\u0027re being so dramatic,\" said Billy\u0027s mother, exasperated. \"Why don\u0027t you help me or Curtis?\" \"No, thanks,\" said Billy, who would go right back to looking miserable. After a few days of this routine Billy did start to get bored. His plan wasn\u0027t working. His mother wasn\u0027t giving in. Billy was going to have to get to like the senior center. The next day after school Billy went to the senior center. He said hello to Curtis and went to the nurse\u0027s station. He did his homework. This time, for a change, when Billy finished his homework, he decided to go exploring. Billy left the nurse\u0027s station and turned right down the hallway. He had never seen the rest of the facility. The building was huge. Every hallway looked the same. Billy followed the hallway until it came to another hallway. After a while, Billy was lost. Billy sat down in the hallway and tried to remember the way back. He didn\u0027t want to ask directions. He wasn\u0027t supposed to be there. He didn\u0027t want to get in trouble. So he sat and tried to remember the way out. He heard something coming from the door nearest him. \"Oh, for goodness\u0027 sake, Henry,\" said a woman. \"You don\u0027t look anything like a Knight of the Realm. You look more like an elephant.\" \"An elephant! Ifl look like an elephant, you look like a peacock,\" a man\u0027s voice replied. \"They must be residents,\" thought Billy. Curious, he crawled over and peeked inside the room. He saw something he had not expected. The woman who was speaking had on a pink track suit and an even pinker feather boa around her shoulders. The man she was speaking to was sitting in a wheel chair, holding a shield and sword, and wearing a helmet. The shield, sword, and helmet were made of paper and glue. They had begun to droop a little. Billy supposed this was why he looked like an elephant. Billy was starting to laugh when he saw the woman in pink looking at him. \"Well, don\u0027tjust sit there spying. Come on in,\" said another man. This man was speaking to Billy. He walked in. \"Who are you?\" they asked. Billy explained that he was waiting for his mother, the nurse. The seniors introduced themselves. The woman in pink was named Mildred. The man with the shield was Harold. \"Pleased to meet you,\" said Billy. He asked them what they were doing. \"We\u0027re rehearsing for the talent show,\" said Mildred. \"You have a talent show here?\" asked Billy. \"Of course,\" said Mildred. \"We\u0027re the Senior Center Dramatic Society. We always perform in the talent show, and we rehearse even when there isn\u0027t a show coming up. Sometimes we make up our own plays.\" \"It\u0027s important to be creative,\" said Harold. \"It keeps you young.\" \"Would you like to help us?\" asked Mildred. \"We need an impartial critic.\" \"My mother told me I\u0027m dramatic,\" said Billy. \"Great,\" said Mildred. \"You\u0027ll fit right in.\" Billy agreed to help. He helped them read their lines and fix their costumes. Afterwards, they took Billy back to the nurse\u0027s station where his mother was waiting. \"Did you have fun?\" his mother asked Billy. \"Yes, I did,\" Billy answered. From that day on Billy spent his afternoons at the center with the Dramatic Society. The seniors weren\u0027t boring at all. "

In 1787, a group of Americans did not like how their new country\u0027s government worked. They sat down to write new rules for the government. Among those men were Ben Franklin and George Washington. The men met at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during a hot summer. Sometimes they had disagreements. They had to work hard to solve those disagreements. When they finished, they had written the country\u0027s Constitution. Next, the Constitution had to be approved by the states. After a few years, the states voted in favor of the Constitution. It was now the law of the land. According to the Constitution, an election for president must be held every four years. The Constitution also says that the United States must have a Congress and a Supreme Court. Congress makes laws. The Supreme Court decides if laws are correctly written and followed. The Constitution promises important rights to the American people. These include the right to believe what you wish and the right to say what you believe. These promises are listed in the part of the Constitution known as the Bill of Rights. "

In the book, a boy named Timmy spends the day with his grandfather, Grandpa Joe. The story takes place in the present and the past. Timmy and his grandfather visit an old farm where Grandpa Joe grew up. Timmy sees the old farmhouse, barn, and tractor. For Grandpa Joe, seeing the tractor brings back special memories. He tells Timmy all about his life on the farm. After I read Grandpa\u0027s Tractor yesterday, I wondered about my grandpa Cesar\u0027s memories. I called him on the phone. \"What were things like for you growing up, Grandpa?\" | asked. \"Did you live on a farm?\" \"No,\" he said. \"I grew up in a small village in Mexico.\" Mexico is a country south of the United States. \"My parents worked on a farm where they picked vegetables,\" Grandpa told me. \"But I went to school in the village. When I was seven years old, my family moved to the United States.\" My grandfather\u0027s life as a boy was different from the grandpa\u0027s in the book. It was also very different from my life now.

        "text": "A Lion in the Bedroom When James woke up, he found a lion sleeping on the floor next to his bed. Because he was five years old, he thought this was awesome. \"Hello, lionl\" he yelled. The lion, a female with a patchy coat, opened one eye and stared at him lazily. Then she turned over and fell back asleep. James considered petting the lion or scratching its belly ,  Trixie, his old cat, loyed belly scratches ,  but he was proud enough of his new pet that he wanted to tell his parents first. He jumped out of bed and walked into the kitchen. His father was eating breakfast. \"Do you want me to strip the bathroom moldings this weekend?\" his father asked his mother. \"Or can it wait a week?\" \"It can wait,\" she said, frowning. \"But you should really want to strip the moldings.\" \"I got a lion!\" yelled James. \"That\u0027s nice, dear,\" said his mother. \"Well played, son,\" said his father. \"Most ?ve-year-olds go with something showier, like an ocelot or a puma. But you\u0027ye gone the classic route.\" ?\u0027ll \"Sure,\" his father said, \"everyone wants to ride their lion to school. But where will you park it?\" \"Bill,\" his mother said. \u0027We\u0027ye talked about your sarcasm.\" \"It\u0027s not sarcasm,\" his father said. \"I\u0027m being funn, \" James\u0027s father didn\u0027t get to finish his sentence. It was interrupted by an ea r-splitting roar, coming from James\u0027s bedroom. For a few seconds, neither one of his parents said anything. \"Maybe I\u0027ll name her Tiger,\" said James. \"To confuse people.\" \"James,\" said his father quietly. \"What was that?\" \"Oh dear me,\" said his mother, crossing herself. James\u0027s father craned his head to peer down the hall towards James\u0027s bedroom. After a moment, he knelt down in front of his son and put his hands on his shoulders. \"James,\" he said. \"I need you to be completely, 100% honest with me. No make-believe, no story-time? Can you do that?\" James nodded. \"Sure I can.\" He noticed a droplet of sweat dripping down his father\u0027s forehead. \"O.l., great,\" said his father, in a strange, small yoice. \"James, is there a |ion...a real |ion...in your bedroom?\" \"Dad,\" said James, patiently. \"We\u0027ve been oyer this.\" His father stared at him. James sighed. \"Of course there is, Dad.\" \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\" his mother screamed. \"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!\" \"Helen, stop it!\" snapped his father. His father stood up. \"This is ridiculous. I don\u0027t know what that noise was, but there is not a lion in your bedroom, James.\" James\u0027s father walked angrily to the broom closet. He opened the door, pulled out a mop with a long wooden handle, and began marching towards the hallway. \"For gosh sake, Bill,\" his mother said, grabbing him by the shoulder. \"Let\u0027s just get out of here and call the police. Or animal control. Or someone. Please.\" \"And tell them what?\" His father wheeled around to face her. \"What? That we have a lion in the house? Oh, I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll send a car right out.\" \"Tell them her name is Trixie ll,\" said James. \"Someone might have met her before.\" \"Bill...\" \"I\u0027m not calling anyone,\" his father said. With that, he turned and stomped down the hallway. James and his mother looked down after him. \"Quiet,\" his mother hissed. They watched his father approach the door. He reached for the handle and, holding the mop high in his other hand, gently swung the door open and poked his head around the corner. James barely had time to be curious about his father\u0027s reaction before his father turned on his heels, slammed the door shut, and went sprinting down the hallway towards James and his mother. \"Get out of the house right now!\" his father hollered as he ran. \"Go! Run! Now! Move! Move! Move!\" His father practically shoved James and his mother through the living room and out the front door. When they were outside, his father doubled over, panting for breath. \"Where in the world did you get a !!on?\" he yelled at James. \"You mean it\u0027s reef?\" his mother screamed, her eyes bugging. \"Ahhhhhhhhhh!\" \"They come from Africa, right?\" said James. By this time, neighbors had heard the commotion and begun gathering. Their next-door neighbors were the Horowitzes. Mr. Horowitz walked up to James\u0027s father. \"Bill, is something the matter?\" James\u0027s father turned and stared at Mr. Horowitz. \"There\u0027s a lion in my son\u0027s bedroom.\" Mr. Horowitz threw a quick, worried glance at his wife, who was standing on their front lawn. His wife shrugged. \"0.|.,\" said Mr. Horowitz, slowly. \"Do you want us to call somebody?\" \"Her name is Trixie ll,\" explained James. \"Or maybe Ms. Botticelli. I like how that name sounds\" \"Call somebody!\" his father yelled. \"Call anybody! There\u0027s a lion in my son\u0027s bedroom.\" By this time a dozen neighbors had gathered in front of James\u0027s house. All of them were yelling at each other, trying to figure out what had happened, when suddenly everyone froze. There, at the front door of James\u0027s house, was the massive African lion. Everyone stared at her, completely silent. For a few moments, the lion stared back. Finally, she let out a long sigh. \"Guys,\" the lion said, \"I know I\u0027m a guest and I don\u0027t mean to be a pain, but I had a really late night last night and l have a client meeting at 10:00, so I was really hoping to sleep in. Do you think you guys could keep it down just a little bit? Thanks.\" And with that, the lion turned and walked back in the house. \"What about Rambo?\" said James. \"That\u0027s a cool name. Rambo. Yeah, I like that.\" "

The Republican Party began in the 1850$. It was nicknamed the \"Grand Old Party,\" or GOP. Republican presidents have included George W. Bush and his  father, George H.W. Bush. Many Americans are members of a political party. No one has to be a member of any party to vote, however. In the end, the voters decide which candidates get elected. "

        "text": "Eight-year-old Maya and her parents were on vacation. They were hiking in the Appalachian Mountains. The Appalachians are the longest group of mountains in eastern North America. These mountains start in the northern U.S. state of Maine. They end in the southern state of Georgia. Maya\u0027s family was walking on a road that goes from one end of the Appalachians to the other. It is called the Appalachian Trail. Maya and her family had started near their home in Maryland. A native of Maryland, Maya had never left her state before. A native is someone who was born in a place. The family\u0027s first stop was in West Virginia. Every evening, Maya and her family would make a campfire. She loved that! She also enjoyed sleeping in a tent each night. Maya wanted to remember everything that happened on her vacation. Whenever she came across a new animal, such as a beaver or a quail, she would draw a picture of it in herjournal. Maya learned that she had to be quiet if she wanted the animals to stay. She also drew a field of daisies. Maya thought that flowers were easier to draw than animals. They didn\u0027t run away! "

Engineers work to find solutions to problems. They also design new products that help people. Some engineers work to make cars safer. Other engineers figure out how to build strong bridges. Some engineers develop new medicines or find better ways to keep foods fresh and safe. Engineers start by identifying a problem to solve or a new product to design. They search for ways to fix the problem or make the product. They look at different ideas and choose the best one. Often, engineers make a model and test it. They look for ways to improve what they have made. Sandra Cruz-Pol is an engineer. She also teaches engineering students at a college. Sandra designs products that let people know when storms and floods are coming. She says it feels good to find ways to improve people\u0027s lives. "

        "text": "A volcano on the island of Hawaii has been erupting for over thirty years. The volcano\u0027s name is Kilauea (kee-lah-WAY-ah). Since 1983, it has released tons of hot, melted rock called lava. Volcanoes are openings on the surface of our planet that can send lava, gas, and steam into the air. You may have seen volcanoes that look like mountains with openings at the top. Many volcanoes look like that. But others appear more like large holes, called craters, on the ground. Most of the world\u0027s volcanoes are found in an area that forms a shape like a horseshoe around the Pacific Ocean. Scientists call that area the \"Ring of Fire.\" Kilauea is a crater volcano. Lava from Kilauea has done a lot of damage. About twenty years ago, the lava flowed over a hundred homes, a church, and a store in the nearby Royal Gardens community. Those places were destroyed. In 2013, another lava flow ruined the only home remaining in that community. Today, Royal Gardens is no longer home to anyone. Scientists say Kilauea\u0027s lava threatens more homes and a forest preserve. The scientists are using computers to map the lava\u0027s path. They hope to predict what Kilauea will do in the future.

        "text": "Wind Power By Rachelle Kreisman \u0027m\u0027\" A windmill is a machine that runs on the power of the wind. Long ago, farmers used windmills to pump water and make flour. Each windmill had blades at the top of a tower. When the wind blew, its power made the blades spin. The spinning blades turned a pole inside the tower. The pole then ran a water pump or moved a stone that ground, or mashed, grain into little pieces. Today, people have learned how to get much more power from the wind. We have made a lot of progress! Now we have wind turbines. These turbines are modern windmills. Wind turbines have large blades at the top of a high pole. The blades spin quickly when the wind blows. When the blades spin, they power a generator. That is a machine that makes electricity. Electricity brings light and power to homes and businesses. Wind turbines are often built in a group in many rows. That group is called a wind farm. Wind farms produce a large amount of electricity. "

        "text": "People have been eating butter for a long time. H was it made in the past? Do we produce it differently today? Long ago, working women called milkmaids poured cow\u0027s milk into pans. The milkmaids knew that when milk got warm, part of it turned into cream. They waited till cream rose to the top of the milk. Then they removed it and let it get sour. That gave the cream flavor. These workers poured the sour cream into wooden tubs called churns. Churns had big paddles that had to be pushed and pulled. That hard work turned cream into butter! The butter was rinsed with cold water. Finally, salt was added to keep the butter from spoiling. Today, we produce butter a little differently. First, cow\u0027s milk goes into big cans that spin the milk. Cream moves to the top. The cream is heated to kill germs. The cooled cream goes into a metal churn that spins like a clothes dryer. The churn tumbles the cream. Soon, butter forms. Salt is added, and the butter is churned again. That butter is sent to a packager. It is shaped into sticks, wrapped, and sold to grocery stores. Then people buy it and take it home! "

The area became known as the Dust Bowl. The problem started when farmers planted more crops than they could sell. The next year, those farmers decided to leave some land empty. The farmers let their cattle graze there, and the cattle ate the grass. Soon, nothing grew on that land.Then came a drought (DROWT). A drought is a long period without rain. Land became very dry. Grass and crops barely grew. Very little was left to hold the soil in place. At the same time, strong winds started blowing. The winds blew layers of soil into the air. Dust covered everything. People had to protect themselves from the dust. Children wore masks and goggles when they walked to school. They used the masks so they would not breathe in dust and get sick. People hung wet sheets over their windows to prevent dust from blowing into their homes. Finally, the rains returned. Farmers could plant crops again. The farmers learned to plant in different places to protect the soil. They also planted grasses to keep the soil in place. "

In some cities, laws said that black people could not sit next to white people on buses. Other laws did not allow black people to use the same drinking fountains or restrooms as white people. One day, an African American woman named Rosa Parks got on a bus. After she sat down, the bus became full. The bus driver told Rosa to give up her seat to a white man. Rosa refused. She believed it was not fair that she had to give up her seat. Rosa was arrested after refusing to move. People heard about Rosa\u0027s protest against the law. Some people said there should be fairer laws. Soon, more people began demanding that the law be changed. Slowly, places in the United States began changing their laws. Bus drivers were no longer allowed to make black people give up their seats. New laws said black people must be able to use the same drinking fountains and restrooms as white people. Rosa Parks spoke out for what she believed in. She was a person of strong character. We remember Rosa today as a hero who worked for fairness and equality. "

        "text": "Abrahams Jared and his family are going to the petting zoo. Jared is nervous. What if one of the animals bites him? \\ \"The animals won\u0027t bite as long as you are nice to them,\" Mom says.\"I\u0027m always nice to animals,\" says Jared. When they get to the zoo, he sees all kinds of animals. There are chickens and lambs. There is a goat and a cow. Jared puts a nickel in a dispenser. A big handful of animal pellets come out. They smell like dirty socks. He holds the pellets up to a goat, and the goat grabs them with his tongue. The tongue is soft and it tickles Jared\u0027s hand.\"Ah!\"Jared yells and jumps back from the goat.\"Bleeeeeeet says the goat. He wants more food. Jared doesn\u0027t have any more food to give him. He keeps walking backward until he feels something fluffy against the back of his legs. A whole flock of sheep are standing together.\"Baaaaaaah!\"they say. They are looking for food from Jared, too. One of the sheep is a little different from the others. It\u0027s a black sheep. Jared walks up to the funny animal. Suddenly, the sheep\u0027s face turns pink. \"Why do you have a pink face?\" he asks the sheep. \"Why do you have a brown face?\" the sheep asks. \"Because that\u0027s the color of my skin!\" Jared says. Suddenly, he realizes the sheep is talking. \"Hey! You can talk!\" \"Only you can hear me,\" says the sheep. \"And only you can see my true color.\" At this, the whole sheep magically turns bright pink. \"Let me introduce myself. I am Gael, the sacred pink sheep. | live in shame.\" \"Why are you ashamed? You are beautiful!\" \"I cannot show my true self to the other sheep,\" he says. \"Why not?\" \"They won\u0027t accept me with my pink face,\" says Gael. Jared couldn\u0027t believe this. The other sheep seemed nice, just hungry. He takes a nickel from his pocket. He gets more smelly treats and walks over to the other sheep. \"Little boy, have you brought us food?\" asks the biggest sheep. \"I have,\" says Jared. \"But first, I have a question.\" \"You can address it to me,\" says the biggest sheep. \"I am the leader, Conrad.\" \"Conrad, are any of you...pink?\" All the sheep begin to laugh. \"Clearly we are not pink, silly boy,\" says Conrad. \"You can see our colors.\" \"What if one of your sheep was secretly pink?\" \"Secretly pink? We would never accept him! He would be a black sheep,\" Conrad says, laughing at his own joke. Gael, the pink sheep, is standing alone on the other side of the petting zoo. He hears every word Conrad says. He begins to cry pink tears. As the tears fall to the ground, little, pink flowers begin to grow. \"Look!\" says Jared, pointing. \"There is your pink sheep. He is making pink flowers grow!\" \"Ohh\" all the other sheep gasp. \"They are beautiful Jared walks to Gael. He picks one of the flowers. Conrad the sheep eats the flower from Jared\u0027s hand. \"This is delicious!\" he exclaims. All around Gael, beautiful pink flowers have grown. Gael himself is glowing pink. I ll \"Behold!\" says Gae My true form!\" Conrad stares at Gael for a very long time. \"I accept you,\" Conrad finally says. \"I wasn\u0027t right to think there\u0027s something wrong with a pink sheep. You have made the most beautiful flowers with your magic.\" I ll \"Thank you, Jared,\" says Gae I have a family again.\" \"Jared!\" Jared\u0027s mother shouts, calling for him. \"It\u0027s time to go home!\" \"I have to go!\" Jared says, running back to his mother. \"So, did you enjoy feeding the animals at the petting zoo today?\" Mom asks. \"More than you\u0027ll ever know!\" says Jared. In his hand is a beautiful pink flower. Jared knows he will always remember this day. He will never forget that being different can also be beautiful. "

        "text": "\"Stop poking the cat,\" Consuela\u0027s mother told her. Every time Consuela poked the cat, Mr. Whiskers, the cat would bat at her with its paw. It was great fun. \"You are going to get scratched.\" Consuela stopped poking. Mr. Whiskers stopped batting. They looked at each other. Mr. Whiskers was mostly black, but had white fur on his belly and paws. He was named Mr. Whiskers because his whiskers were long. Consuela reached out and touched one of them. Mr. Whiskers blinked. She touched another one. Mr. Whiskers blinked again. Then he yawned. \"Why does Mr. Whiskers blink when I touch his whisker?\" Consuela asked her mother. \"Cats have very sensitive whiskers. They help them feel what\u0027s around them.\" \"Why does Mr. Whiskers bat at me when I poke him?\" \"He\u0027s practicing hunting. Cats use their paws to catch birds and mice and fish to eat. Sometimes they get excited and forget it\u0027s only practice. That\u0027s when they can scratch you. Cats are very good at hunting.\" \"I\u0027ve never seen Mr. Whiskers hunt anything. If I don\u0027t play with him, all he does is sleep.\" Mr. Whiskers was now stretched out on the rug asleep. Consuela thought Mr. Whiskers was too lazy to hunt anything. Every time she played with him, he usually got tired and went to sleep pretty quickly. He was an old cat. \"That\u0027s because Mr. Whiskers has an easier way of getting food.\" Consuela\u0027s mother got up and went into the kitchen. She opened the bag of cat food and poured it into his dish. Mr. Whiskers heard the rustle. He woke right up. His ears perked up and pointed forward. Then he ran to the kitchen. Mr. Whiskers\u0027 favorite thing to do was eat. He liked it even more than sleeping. \"How can Mr. Whiskers always tell when it\u0027s dinner?\" Consuela asked. \"The same way you can tell it\u0027s dinner. He uses his ears and his nose. You smell food just like Mr. Whiskers smells food. You hear me call \u0027dinner\u0027 the same way Mr. Whiskers hears me pour cat food in his bowl. All animals have to eat if they want to stay alive. Just like you. So it\u0027s pretty important they figure out how to get food one way or another. It\u0027s so important that even though there\u0027s nothing for Mr. Whiskers to hunt, he still practices.\" "

        "text": "Have you ever heard of an avalanche? Avalanches are sudden natural events where large amounts of snow and ice slide down a mountain. As they slide, the snow and ice get faster. In fact, snow from an avalanche can move as fast as two hundred miles per hour. That is three times faster than a car on a highway! Most avalanches happen after big storms. New snow puts added pressure on snow already on the mountain. That added pressure can make the old snow break loose and start sliding. Avalanches are dangerous. Heavy snow moving down a mountain may pull other things along, such as trees and rocks. A powerful avalanche can damage everything in its path. Many people like to ski and snowboard. They want to have fun on mountains. They also want to stay safe. Experts can usually tell when an avalanche might happen. The experts can warn people of the risk. The risk may below or high. People have to pay attention to warnings to be safe. "

The United Nations was created to try to prevent wars. The U.N. sometimes sends special soldiers, called peacekeepers, to countries that are having problems. The peacekeepers work to keep things calm while the countries work out their differences. The U.N. also helps people who live in places that do not have enough food, clean water, or medicine. For example, if a country has been harmed by a storm, United Nations workers may bring medicine and food to that area. The leader of the United Nations is the secretary-general. Members of the U.N. elect the secretary-general. The secretary-general speaks for the organization. The secretary-general also directs all the departments of the U.N. All member nations belong to a group called the General Assembly. Countries can bring their disagreements to the General Assembly. Sometimes, General Assembly members vote on what the U.N. should do to try to resolve disagreements. The U.N. headquarters is in New York City. Outside the headquarters, flags from all of the members\u0027 countries stand tall. They represent the United Nations\u0027 goal: Build cooperation among countries for a safer, more peaceful world. "

His mom was making pancakes: Daniel\u0027s favorite. She made pancakes every Saturday morning. \"What do you want to do today?ll she asked Daniel. \"I think I\u0027m going to go exploring in our backyard,he told her. \"It\u0027s so nice outside!\"Daniel gobbled up his pancakes and rushed upstairs to get dressed. He put on a red t-shirt and jeans. \"Alright, Mom, I\u0027ll be back later!\" \"Don\u0027t go too far!\"she told him. When he opened the door, Daniel felt a rush of warm air. He smiled at the sun. Perfect hiking weather, he thought. Daniel loved his backyard. There were plenty of tall trees. If he walked far enough, he would reach a creek. When it was really warm outside, he could walk in the water to cool off. The water was always cold. The leaves were just beginning to grow on the trees after the cold winter. Daniel wandered for a bit. He picked up a long stick and used it to clear a way through the forest. Suddenly, Daniel saw something in the distance that wasn\u0027t a rock or a leaf. When he got closer, he knelt down to investigate. He found a small injured bird between the fallen leaves. He looked around and saw a bird\u0027s nest sitting on a branch. He carefully climbed up the trunk of the tree with the nest to get a closer look. The nest was empty, and he didn\u0027t see any birds around. Then, he ran back to his house. \"Mom, I found a bird that\u0027s hurt!\" he told her as he ran through the door. She looked for a shoebox, and then she said, \"Well, let\u0027s go have a look.\" Daniel led his mom back to the injured bird. His mom knelt down and looked carefully at it. \"Let\u0027s try to save it!\" she said. She gently picked up the bird and put it in the shoebox. Then she said, \"We can take it to the animal hospital in town.\" They took the bird to the animal hospital. After a few days, the vet visited Daniel\u0027s house with the bird. It was healed. Daniel and his mom could hear the bird chirping when they opened the door. The vet said, \"The bird is ready to go back to its home in the trees.\" Daniel was so excited. He looked at the bird and said, \"I\u0027m going to name you Chirp! I hope I can see you again. Bye, Chirp!\" "

People are chosen to design and build the playground. They know they must keep costs low. The design team decides to save money by reusing materials. The team will use old tires to make swings. The designers will recycle plastic bottles and milk jugs to make rides. Someone suggests building play tunnels out of old plastic tubes. Those ideas will save money. The ideas will also help the earth by not making more trash. The team builds a model using recycled materials. The designers bring their model to the town leaders. The leaders look it over. They ask lots of questions. The leaders ask for some changes, but they like what they see. The model helps everyone understand how the playground can work. Soon, the playground is built. It looks like the model, only much bigger! "

        "text": "Making Piano Fun W.M. Akers \"Come on, Angie. It\u0027s time to go.\" \"I\u0027m not going,\" said Angela. \"Please,\" said her father. \"We\u0027re going to be late.\" \"Good. I hope we are late. I hope we\u0027re a million years late, and by the time we get to the music school, piano doesn\u0027t even exist anymore. The people of the future will be smart. They\u0027ll understand that mankind is better off without the piano. They\u0027ll understand me.\" \"Okay, sweetheart. That\u0027s great. Please get in the car.\" \"No. On no account. This is America, Dad. Didn\u0027t you hear? Nobody can make anybody play piano against her will. It\u0027s called democracy.\" \"Angela? If you don\u0027t get in that car right now, your mother is going to be very angry at me. And if she\u0027s angry at me, I\u0027m going to forbid you from using the computer.\" \"For how long?\" \"Until Christmas.\" Dad wasn\u0027t joking. Angela got in the car. As they drove, beads of sweat formed on the back of her neck, and her stomach started to feel like she had just swallowed a hockey puck. Practicing piano scared her to death. Her teacher, Mr. Poliakoff, was a hairy old man who talked with a lisp that made him nearly impossible to understand. She could never tell if he was saying, \"I see,\" or calling for a \"high C.\" Uncertainty made Angela nervous, and nerves made it impossible for her to play. Not that Angela wanted to play anyway. She thought that there was no music on Earth more boring than Mr. Poliakoff\u0027s sheet music. For three months, she had gone once a week to learn famous compositions like \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,\" \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat,\" and \"Three Blind Mice.\" As boring as those songs were, they were apparently impossible to play. Each time Angela picked up her fingers she was seized by fear. What if she played the wrong note? Would Mr. Poliakoff shout at her? Or, worse, would he simply shake his head in disappointment? \"Fear is the enemy of success,\" he would tell her, except that when he said it, it sounded more like \"sushshesh.\" But when it came to the piano, fear was all Angela had. \"Timbuktu,\" she said. Her dad looked away from the road to give her a funny look. She went on. \"Antarctica. The Yukon. Kazakhstan. Borneo. Tasmania.\" \"Yes?\" asked her father, finally. \"I\u0027m trying to think of places I\u0027d like less than piano class.\" \"Did you come up with anything?\" \"Nope. Even the middle of the Amazon rainforest would be more fun.\" \"Well, I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve been studying your geography, at least.\" When her father looked away, Angela stuck out her tongue. That would show him. As usual, Mr. Poliakoff\u0027s music school smelled like cabbage. Angela did not know where he might be cooking the foul vegetable, but she was certain she didn\u0027t want to find out. She trudged down the darkened hallway like her feet were made of rocks, glad her father wasn\u0027t there to tell her she was going to be late. \"Not that he cares anyway,\" she thought. \"He\u0027s done his job, dropping me off at the building. He doesn\u0027t even care if I actually make it to class.\" Angela\u0027s eyes went wide. She had an idea. She pressed her back against the wall and slinked away from Mr. Poliakoff\u0027s classroom. She would have to spend an hour in the music school, but that didn\u0027t mean she had to learn any music. She tip-toed down the dark corridor, fearful that her piano teacher might burst out at any moment and bellow, \"You! Come here and practice \u0027Ring Around the Rosie!\u0027\" But the door did not open. Mr. Poliakoff did not catch her. Angela was free. She was sneaking her way to the front door of the music school, planning on passing the hour in the sun, beneath a tree or on a bench, when she heard a funny sound. It sounded like someone playing the piano, scales, but it sounded different than what she was used to. It sounded like the person playing was having fun. She followed the sound. It was coming from one of the classrooms. She peered through the glass window and saw that the piano bench was empty. Feeling sneaky, she turned the handle and padded into the empty classroom. The music was coming from a computer in the corner. She walked towards it, dying to find out what it was, when she learned the room wasn\u0027t as empty as she had thought. \"Hello?\" said a voice that stopped Angela\u0027s heart. It came from a woman with long, gray hair and a mouth that twisted up a little bit at the sides. \"Can I help you?\" \"No,\" stammered Angela. \"I, uh, Ijust heard the music, and, \" \"Do you like the piano?\" \"I hate the piano,\" said Angela. The woman started to laugh. \"Well!\" she said. \"That\u0027s too bad for you, since you\u0027re in a music school.\" \"No kidding.\" \"I\u0027m Mrs. O\u0027Hara.\" \"That\u0027s nice. I should be going.\" \"Hold on, hold on. You wanted to know about this music?\" Angela was silent. \"Come on. It\u0027s okay to be curious. Do you know anything about jazz?\" \"No.\" \"Well, here it is.\" She turned up the volume. The man playing piano tapped at the keys like a baby hitting something with a hammer. He sang like a clown, making strange noises and putting on all sorts of funny voices. The words he sang were even stranger: All that meat and no potatoes All that food to the alligators, yes. Hold me steady. I am ready For all that meat and no potatoes. \"It sounds so silly!\" \"Well, that\u0027s Fats,\" said Mrs. O\u0027Hara. \"Who\u0027s Fats?\" \"Fats Waller. The piano player. He\u0027s the one who wrote the song.\" \"A grown-up wrote this song?\" \"A very talented grown-up. Don\u0027t think about the silly words. Listen to the piano. What does it sound like?\" \"It sounds crazy.\" \"It\u0027s all over the place, isn\u0027t it?\" Mrs. O\u0027Hara was right. None of his notes were where Angela was taught they were supposed to be. He played fast when he should have played slowly; he played slowly when he should have played fast. In between lines, he would shout nonsense like, \"Oh, stop it, Thomas! You\u0027re tickling early!\" Crazy was the only word for it. \"Who\u0027s Thomas?\" asked Angela. \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Huh. Well, I guess I should get going.\" \"You\u0027re supposed to be in class, aren\u0027t you?

Fats Waller spent a lot of time learning to play normal piano before he could start playing it crazy.\" \"He played \u0027Ring Around the Rosie?\u0027\" \"And \u0027Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,\u0027 and \u0027Three Blind Mice,\u0027 and all of Mr. Poliakoff\u0027s favorites.\" \"But ifI learn to play those...eventually I can play this?\" \"You got it,\" said Mrs. O\u0027Hara, as she sat down beside the bench. Angela put her fingers on the keys and prepared to play. Her fingers weren\u0027t afraid any more. "

They are called continents. People make maps to show what our planet looks like. Looking at a map, you can learn how far one place is from another. You can see which continent is also an island. (The answer is Australia.) You can figure out which ocean is the largest. (The answer is the Pacific.) Over the years, mapmakers drew many maps to help people travel around the world. Then explorers visited places some people did not know about. The explorers shared their discoveries. Mapmakers added the information to their maps. About a hundred years ago, one scientist studied a world map and was surprised. Alfred Wegener thought the edges of two continents looked like matching parts in a jigsaw puzzle. He wondered if Africa and South America had once been joined. Wegener came up with a theory: Millions of years ago, all the continents fit together. Many people thought he was crazy. But today, scientists believe that Alfred Wegener was correct. "

        "text": "Sometimes accidents turn into inventions. Post-it Notes are a good example. Post-its are those little sticky papers perfect for marking your place on a book page. Two researchers, Spencer Silver and Arthur Fry, accidentally invented Post-it Notes. At the time, they were working for a company called 3M. Silver and Fry were both trying to develop extra-strong glue. But the glue they produced was weak. It did not seem useful at all. One day, Fry had an idea. He put the glue on a piece of paper and used the paper as a bookmark. Fry saw that this bookmark would stay on a page. He could remove it and stick it onto another page. The paper did not fall off. Researchers worked to improve the glue. They made sure the glue stayed on the piece of paper and not on the page. In 1980, the company named the product Post-it Notes. The product was a great success! Today, Post-it Notes are one of the most popular office products in the world. They come in different sizes and many colors. Have you ever used Post-it Notes? What do you think of this invention? "

        "text": "Stacey\u0027s mother worked at home. She spent all day at the computer. Sometimes she typed. Sometimes she clicked. Sometimes she looked at videos. She was a writer, so being at the computer was her job. The computer was her most important tool. It worked very well. There was only one problem. It was boring. The computer was grey. It had black keys and a smudged screen. It was not pretty at all. Stacey\u0027s mother never complained about this. But Stacey could tell it bothered her. Anyone would be bothered if they had to work all day on such an ugly computer. And so, one day while her mother was taking a bath, Stacey decided to help.  She was going to make her mother\u0027s computer beautiful Mommy\u0027s gonna love it,\" she said to herself as she got to work. The first problem was the color. Grey simply would not do. If Stacey were allowed to have a computer, she would want it to be pink. But Mommy\u0027s favorite color was purple. So Stacey got out her purple marker and started coloring. As the marker dragged across the plastic computer, it made a squinch squinch squinch noise. Stacey did not like the sound. But she loved the way it looked. \"Much better!\" she said as she finished. \"Now we need some sparkle.\" Stacey took out a bottle of glue and spread big globs of it on the computer\u0027s shell. She tipped whole handfuls of glitter, blue, pink, and red, all over. Most of it stuck, and she only got a little glue in her hair. \"This looks almost perfect,\" said Stacey. \"But what\u0027s missing?\" It only took her a moment to guess the answer. \"Stickers!\" Stacey\u0027s mom liked to wear hats. And Stacey had lots of stickers of hats. She had pink hats, blue hats, and orange ones. She had fedoras and top hats and cowboy hats and even a funny hat called a \"porkpie hat.\" She put them all over Mommy\u0027s computer, right on the screen. She knew it was perfect when there was no part of the computer that wasn\u0027t covered in hats, glitter, or purple marker. \"Stacey? What are you doing with my computer?\" Stacey\u0027s mom stood in the doorway, wrapped in a bathrobe, her hair dripping wet. \"Look, Mommy! I made it beautiful.\" Stacey\u0027s mom screamed as loud as she ever had. She tried to peel off the stickers, but they wouldn\u0027t come off. She scraped at the glitter, but it was stuck. And she was never going to get the marker off. \"Stacey Miller,\" shouted Stacey\u0027s mom. \"You are in so much trouble!\" Stacey began to think that maybe Mommy didn\u0027t love it after all. "

They stretch from Canada in the North to the U.S. state of New Mexico in the South. The Rocky Mountains also go through Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, and Colorado. The Rockies are the longest mountain range in North America. They have many high peaks. The highest is Mount Elbert in Colorado. It is nearly three miles high. Mount Elbert\u0027s peak is fourteen thousand feet above sea level. In the summer, the Rockies are warm and dry, though it does rain sometimes. During the winter, the weather is wet and very cold. Heavy winter snow falls in the higher parts of the Rockies. Many people like to visit these mountains. Here they ride bikes, hike on trails, ski, or fish. A special area called Rocky Mountain National Park is in Colorado. The national park is reserved for people to visit but not to live in or build in. Visitors to Rocky Mountain National Park are excited to see the wild animals that live there. Those animals include elk, moose, mountain goats, and mountain sheep. "

Martin wanted to build a new birdhouse. The last one he had built fell apart after one windy night. This time, Martin knew he had to make a stronger birdhouse. He just was not sure how to do that. Martin asked his friend Diego for help. Diego was good at building things. Martin explained his idea about the birdhouse, but Diego was confused. So Martin drew a picture to show what he was thinking. Diego looked at the sketch carefully. \"Why does the hole for the bird need to be so big?\" he asked Martin. \"It doesn\u0027t,\" said Martin. \"You\u0027re right.\"Diego also suggested that the birdhouse could be attached to the tree in a much better way. He drew another picture to show Martin how that attachment would work. After talking a while longer, Martin and Diego drew one more sketch. Then they began building the birdhouse together. \"We are a good team,\" Martin told Diego. \"I think your ideas will make my birdhouse stronger!\" "

        "text": "Telephones help people speak to one another when they are apart. For more than a hundred years, nearly every telephone was a landline. A landline telephone is one that needs to be connected by a wire to a network of other telephones. Because of the wires, people could not take those telephones with them when they left their homes or offices. What if you had to make a call while you were away from home? You had to find a pay phone. Pay phones are landlines found in public places. Many pay phones are on the street. You can make a call from inside a glass or metal space called a phone booth. Once you are inside the booth, you put coins into a slot in the phone to make a call. Telephones have seen a lot of progress. Today, many people carry cell phones. Cell phones do not need to be connected with wires. They can be used almost anywhere and can fit in an adult\u0027s hand. Many cell phones sold today are smartphones. A smartphone is a cell phone that has lots of computer-style features. For example, people use smartphones to check e-mail and go on the Internet. And all that can be done using something small enough to carry in a pocket! "

The president is the leader of the American government. The president suggests laws he or she thinks the country needs. The president may work with the members of the U.S. Congress to get those ideas turned into laws. The president appoints people to help run the government. These people include judges and leaders of government departments. Often, the president\u0027s choices have to be approved by the U.S. Congress. The president is commander-in-chief of the country\u0027s military. That means the president is responsible for the actions of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Coast Guard. During any one day, an American president can do many things. The president can speak with advisors, give a speech, or sign a bill into law. The president may meet with leaders of other countries. In the evening, the president sometimes attends special events. Being president of the United States is a difficult, complicated job. "

When I visit him, my grandpa likes to talk about the past. His favorite stories are about his life when he was my age. Grandpa grew up in a city. When he was a boy, he lived in an apartment building on the third floor. His dad owned a clothing store. Grandpa walked to and from school alone. After school, his friends often played baseball on the streets nearby. \"We never played with computers,\" he told me, \"because nobody had a computer at home.\" At night, his mom cooked dinner for just the two of them. His dad did not come home till very late.My life is much different from Grandpa\u0027s life as a boy. I live in a house in a small town.  My dad is a teacher, and my mom is a scientist. I take the bus to and from school. Dad is already home when I get there after school. I do homework and sometimes play on our computer. My dad cooks dinner. When mom comes home from work, the three of us eat together. "

A budget is a plan for how to spend and save money. Companies and countries have budgets to manage their spending. Putting together a budget can help you, too. Do you get a weekly allowance? That is a regular amount of money you might receive to pay for things such as snacks, games, and toys. What would happen to a boy who got his allowance on Monday and spent it all by Wednesday? He would not have any money to spend for the rest of the week! You can avoid that problem by following a budget. First, figure out how much you have to spend. Include money you earn, gifts you receive, and money you have already saved. Next, write down what you spend money on each week. Maybe you will find you are spending a lot on snacks. Cutting down would help you save some money every week. You could then use your savings for something special. That is the benefit of a budget! "

One of the first bicycles was called the hobby horse. It was made of wood! People rode by pushing their feet along on the ground. Later, a bicycle that had pedals and metal tires was invented. It was not comfortable. It was called the boneshaker. Inventors kept working to make bicycles more comfortable. Next, the high wheeler was developed. It had a very big wheel in the front. This bicycle was not easy to ride, because the rider sat high up on the bike. The rider could be badly hurt in a fall. Then bicycles began to have two wheels that were the same size. Those bikes looked more like bicycles today. More than one hundred years ago, bicycles began to have rubber tires filled with air. That was a solution to the problem of a bumpy ride. The new tires made riding smoother. Today, children\u0027s bicycles and racing bikes are popular. People ride bikes to get exercise. Bicycling is safer, too. Now people wear helmets, and bikes have reflectors on them."

The cliffs of the Grand Canyon are made of brown, red, and yellow rocks and sand. It is one mile from the top of the cliffs to the floor of the canyon. The Colorado River flows along the canyon floor. Nature made the Grand Canyon. For millions of years, scientists say, rain and river water hit the canyon\u0027s rocks and sand. Strong winds blew on the cliffs. Water wore down the rocks. Together, the wind and rushing water created the canyon we see today. Even today, wind and water are changing the canyon by reshaping the rocks and battering the cliffs. The change is very slow, but it never stops. A million years from now, the Grand Canyon will look very different. "

Some of those properties are color, shape, size, and texture. Bowling balls and tennis balls are both solids. Each has its own shape. You can see and touch both of them. Are they different? Let\u0027s compare. Most tennis balls are yellow or green, but they also come in many other colors. Most bowling balls are black, but they come in many colors, too. Both kinds of balls are round. They do, however, have very different sizes. Tennis balls are small. You can hold a tennis ball in one hand. A bowling ball is much bigger. It is also much heavier than a tennis ball. Bowling balls and tennis balls have different textures. A bowling ball is smooth. A tennis ball has a soft and fuzzy texture. What can a tennis ball do that a bowling ball cannot? Bounce! Tennis balls are made to bounce. Bowling balls do not bounce. Both bowling balls and tennis balls are solids. But they are also very different from each other! "

        "text": "Moka is a little golden dog that speaks English. No one seems to know but me. Myjob is to feed Moka and take her for walks when her family goes away on vacation. I\u0027ve asked them about Moka before. I\u0027ve said, \"Are you aware, Mr. and Mrs. Quimpy, that your little golden dog speaks English?\" Mr. and Mrs. Quimpy laugh and tell me to have a nice weekend and not to give little Moka too much to eat. Then they leave for their vacation. Moka comes bouncing down the stairs, wagging her little golden tail and barking with joy. \"Moka!\" I shout. \"Would you like me to scratch behind your ears?\" \"Forevermore!\" she yaps. \"Would you like me to rub your little golden belly?\" \"Forevermore! Forevermore!\" \u0027Forevermore\u0027 is the only word I\u0027ve ever heard Moka say. When I have felt lonely, l have asked her, \"How long do you think you will love me?\" \"Forevermore she yaps. When I have felt tired, I\u0027ve told her, \"It is so difficult being a writer. How much longer do you think I should keep trying?\" \"Forevermore! Forevermore!\" Although Moka only ever says that one word, she always says just what I need to hear. Mr. and Mrs. Quimpy have a very special granddaughter named Samantha. One day, while her grandma and grandpa are getting ready to leave, Samantha asks me, \"Hey, Jesse, did you know that the little golden dog speaks English?\" \"You mean Moka talks to you, too?\" I ask, overjoyed to finally find someone else who knows. \"But she only ever says one word,\" says Samantha. \"She says, \u0027Nevermore.\u0027\" \"Nevermore?\" I ask. \"Yes,\" says Samantha. \"I ask her, \u0027Will I be afraid of the dark tonight?\u0027 And Moka yaps, \u0027Nevermore!\u0027 I ask, \u0027Do you think I\u0027ll get too nervous to raise my hand and answer the questions in class tomorrow?\u0027 And Moka yaps, \u0027Nevermore! Nevermore!\u0027 It\u0027s so strange, Jesse. But even though Moka only ever says one word, she always says just what I need to hear.\" Just then, Moka comes bouncing down the stairs, wagging her little, golden tail and barking with joy. \"Hey, Moka,\" Samantha and I say at the same time, \"how do you always tell us just what we need to hear?\" Moka looks at Samantha and me for a long time. \"I don\u0027t know,\" she says at last. \"I just tell the truth.\" "

A habitat is a place where animals and plants live. Hot deserts are home to many kinds of living things. Animals living there include owls, snakes, lizards, and coyotes. Another hot desert animal is the kangaroo rat. It sleeps underground during the day, when the weather is hot. The kangaroo rat comes out at night, when it is cooler. Kangaroo rats get the water they need from food. They eat mostly seeds. Some plants live in the hot desert. Only a few kinds of trees and bushes can survive there. One of the most common desert plants is the cactus. The cactus collects and stores water in its stem. Sharp spines protect most cacti from animals. "

Any change to an ecosystem may affect all the wildlife that live in it. In 1975, the American crocodile was listed as an endangered animal. Endangered animals are close to disappearing forever. One reason why the American crocodiles were in danger was that people were moving into the reptiles\u0027 ecosystem. People built homes and businesses on Everglades land. That made it harder for the crocodiles to find food and lay eggs. People who were worried about the crocodiles and other wildlife in the Everglades worked to pass laws to protect the ecosystem. Today, there is good news. Scientists say there are more than a thousand American crocodiles living in southern Florida. The laws are helping the crocodiles survive. "

        "text": "Humans have always traveled on land. But long ago, people realized they could travel on water, too. They just had to build something that would float and carry people. People began making boats out of tree trunks. By carving space in the trunks, people could sit down. Wooden paddles were good for moving these boats through the water. Some people wanted a boat that traveled more quickly. They tried adding sails to their boats. The wind blew the sails and helped the boats move faster. Now folks could travel long distances on rivers and lakes. They could trade food and other things with people far away. About five hundred years ago, explorers began to dream of crossing oceans to find other lands. People began building large wooden ships with three or four sails. Many explorers traveled across the ocean. The trips took months. Over time, ocean travel became faster. Steamships, powered by steam engines, traveled across the ocean. Their trips took weeks, not months. Today, huge supertankers carry oil across oceans. Cargo ships carry food, furniture, and machines across oceans for people to buy and use. Water travel is still helping people get food and goods. "

        "text": "Most blankets just keep people warm when they go to sleep. A memory quilt (KWILT) quilt is a blanket that does a lot more than that. Any is made with pieces of fabric. The person who creates a memory quilt uses those pieces of fabric to honor a person, a family, a team, or even a country. People make memory quilts by bringing together lots of small fabric squares. For example, a mother creating this kind of quilt might use pieces of her son\u0027s old baby outfit to remind her of the early days of his life. She could also include drawings or photographs of her son that have been printed on fabric. When fabric squares are ready, a quilter sews them together. This can be done by hand or with a sewing machine. The squares become one big piece of fabric. That is the quilt\u0027s top layer. Two other fabric layers are needed. The middle layer is the blanket filling. The backing is the bottom layer. After the layers are sewn together, the quilt is finished. Memory quilts are a beautiful way to remember something or someone special. "

Show buildings, trees, parks, and roads nearby. You may need to go outside to do this part. Do not let the map cover the entire piece of paper! When you are done mapping, find a corner of the page to make a legend. A legend is a box that tells what each symbol means. Draw a house, a tree, a road, and any other symbol you used. Then write the names of each symbol. Finally, show your friends your map. See if they can find their way around using your creation. "

        "metadata": "Grade: 2 Lexile: 610L",
        "text": "Celia likes to dig in the backyard. She calls this game \"Treasure Hunt.\" When she plays Treasure Hunt, she puts on a tan explorer hat and a jacket with big pockets for collecting things. She is Celia the Brave, the greatest treasure hunter in the world. She digs with the shovel and pours the dirt into the sieve. Then, Celia, the greatest treasure hunter in the world, shakes the sieve all around. She shakes it very gently, up and down, then side to side. Shaking dirt around is one of her favorite things to do. When she does this, all the big rocks stay on top of the sieve. They are too big to fall through the holes. She finds rocks with beautiful stripes and patterns in them. The sun catches the edges of the rocks, and some of them shine like gemstones. The rocks she finds in her yard look different from the rocks she finds at her grandmother\u0027s house. She wonders why. For example, one rock she finds in her yard is broken in half, and she can see the inside of it. It has stripes and dots in it. It is grey and white. But the rocks from her grandmother\u0027s yard are orange. She asks herself why the rocks are striped with different colors and patterns. She walks into the kitchen. Her father is making dessert. He is a pastry chef at a fancy restaurant. His job is to make sweets all day. \"Are these jewels?\" she asks her father. \"Those are rocks,\" he says. But to her, they are still jewels. \"Why do they have stripes in them?\" Celia asks. \"I think you should do research at the library,\" her father says. \"You always say that!\" says Celia. \"I always say that because it\u0027s always a good idea,\" says her father. The next day, Celia puts her favorite rock in her lunchbox and brings it to school. All day, she feels like she has a secret. After school, she goes to see the librarian. She brings her secret rock with her. \"Hello Celia,\" says Mr. Beakman the librarian. \"I\u0027m Celia the Treasure Hunter today,\" Celia explains. She shows him her favorite rock. \"I see,\" says the librarian. \"And I guess you want to know more about it.\" Mr. Beakman takes Celia to the computer. He types in \"Geology.\" Geology is the study of the physical earth, including rocks and minerals. He shows Celia where to find books on geology. But the books are for older, high school students, and there are many words she doesn\u0027t know yet. So she just looks at the pictures, instead. Celia sees pictures of fossils and dinosaur bones. In the next picture, a volcano erupts and a layer of lava pours over the dinosaur. That lava dries and traps the bones inside. The next series of photos shows a big piece of ice called a glacier. The glacier melts and runs down over the rocks. It pushes different rocks with it. It makes patterns on the rock called striations. Celia is confused. She understands how the water makes grooves in the top of the rock. But how would this make stripes inside of a rock? She goes home after school and finds her father in the kitchen. She shows him the book. \"Can you help me understand how stripes get inside of a rock?\" she asks. Her father looks at the book and nods. \"Do you see the dessert I\u0027m making?\" he asks. \"It\u0027s called tiramisu. Watch how I make it. It might help you understand.\" First, he puts down a layer of tiny cakes called \"lady fingers.\" Celia giggles at the name. Of course, they aren\u0027t actually fingers! After he has one layer of cake, he spreads a layer of sugary cheese on top. This is followed by another layer of cake, another layer of delicious sweet cheese, and so on. The tiramisu is in a deep glass bowl, and you can see the layers through the glass. There is one layer of cake, and then there is one layer of cheese; it repeats all the way up to the top. \"It looks like a pattern,\" she says. \"It looks like stripes through the glass.\" \"Well, I\u0027m no geologist,\" says dad. \"I\u0027m just a pastry chef. But I think your rock was made in a similar way to my dessert. One layer at a time.\" He cuts a slice of cake and puts it on a plate. \"Now imagine that instead of cake, these layers were made of different types of rocks.\" \"I understand now!\" says Celia. Then she says, \"Good thing there are no dinosaur bones in my dessert.\" Celia and her father decide to eat some of the lesson. You can\u0027t eat rocks, but these layers are delicious! "

        "text": "Oranges from Tree to You By Susan LaBella Oranges are round, juicy fruits that grow on trees in places with warm weather. How does an orange get from the tree to your refrigerator? People who work as fruit pickers move through groves filled with orange trees. When an orange is ripe, the picker clips it off the tree. All picked oranges are then carefully moved to a packing plant. In the plant, oranges are placed on a machine with moving rollers. Special brushes wash the fruit as it rolls along. Next, each orange is dried. Another machine lines up the oranges in boxes. A computer checks each box. Any oranges with spots or damage are removed. Orange growers want to produce good fruit that people will buy. Finally, each orange is given a sticker and placed in a box. Full boxes are shipped in cool trucks to stores. Each storeowner places the oranges on shelves. Then someone from your family comes to the store. Your family member chooses a few oranges, buys them, brings them home, and puts them in your refrigerator. Then, one day, you open your refrigerator, and there those oranges are, ready for you to eat! "

Jenny wanted to go to the pond. There, she could watch the ducks or read a book. But Jake didn\u0027t want to watch the ducks. Jake couldn\u0027t read books. Jake just wanted to go home. He walked toward the farm. \"No, Jake!\" Jenny said, and pulled back on the rope around Jake\u0027s neck. Jake\u0027s big brown head came up. He stopped and looked at her. He was not happy- Jenny\u0027s dad, Bill, was walking down the path to the farm. He saw Jake stop. \"Aww, poor Jake,\" he said. \"He\u0027s just barn sour!\" \"What does barn sour mean?\" Jenny asked. \"It means he wants to go back to the barn. He is hungry and tired. Jake is a sweet horse, but he\u0027ll be sour now until he gets home.\" Bill smiled. \"So barn sour is bad?\" Jenny said. \"Jake is bad?\" \"No, Jake is not bad.\" Bill said. \"We all get tired and hungry sometimes. Maybe you should take him home now.\" Bill walked to the barn. Jenny frowned. \"But I want to go to the pond,\" she said. She got down from Jake and pulled his rope. Jake\u0027s head came down toward Jenny. But his feet did not move. Jenny pulled again, using both hands. She pulled hard. Her small round face turned red. Her hair flopped up and down on her back. Jake took two steps down the path to the pond. But then he stopped again. Now he looked mad. Jenny was mad now, too. She pulled one more time, even harder. Her boots kicked up a cloud of dust from the path. \"Come on, Jake!\" This time, Jake didn\u0027t go to her. He pulled, too! Jake was a big, strong horse. Jenny was a small girl. Jenny could not stop Jake. And she didn\u0027t just step. She flew! The rope fell. Jenny fell. It hurt. She looked at Jake. Jake looked at Jenny. Then, he put his head down and started eating the grass near the path. Jenny knew she was not going to win. And now, she was tired too. She could hear Bill ringing the dinner bell at her house. Jenny sighed. She got back onto Jake. \"Come on, Jake,\" she said. \"Let\u0027s go home. I\u0027m sorry. I think I am barn sour too.\" Jake seemed to nod. They walked together toward home. "

Now she wanted to know her family\u0027s story. \"So, Mom,\" Kate said one night, \"do you know about anyone in our family who immigrated to America?\" \"Yes, certainly,\" said Mrs. Johnson. \"My great-grandmother came to the U.S. from Ireland. She was eighteen years old. Her name was Bridget O\u0027Shea, and she was your great-great, grandmother.\" \"Did you know her?\" Kate asked. \"No, she died before I was born,\" Mrs. Johnson answered. \"But I know she came to New York by steamship from Liverpool, England. She married a man named Mr. O\u0027Brien. They lived in New Jersey.\" \"What else do you know?\" Kate wondered. \"Bridget and her husband had four children,\" Kate\u0027s mom replied. \"Jack, the youngest, moved to Oklahoma.\" \"Did Jack have kids?\" Kate asked. Kate\u0027s mom thought. \"Yes, he did. He and his wife had three children. You might have cousins in Oklahoma.\" \"Mom!\" said Kate. \"Can we try to find them? Maybe we could meet them!\" \"Sure,\" said Mrs. Johnson. \"We can always use more relatives.\" "

        "text": "Farmers Grow Corn By Susan LaBella People have grown corn in America for hundreds of years. Native Americans planted and ate corn long ago. When the Pilgrims arrived, some Native Americans taught them how to grow it. Today, the United States produces more corn than any other country. American farmers plant corn seeds in the spring when the weather is warm enough. If a farmer plants when the soil is too cold, the seeds will rot. Corn needs plenty of space to grow. It has to have a lot of sunshine and the right amount of water. If farmers have good weather, they can pick their corn by September. If the weather is too dry or cold or stormy, the corn may not grow very well. When it is ready, many farmers sell their corn. People buy corn to eat, of course. Some companies buy corn to feed to farm animals. Other companies buy it to produce different foods or drinks. There are even companies that buy corn to make fuel for cars! That fuel is called ethanol. When the growing season is over, farmers let their fields rest. In the spring, many farmers will plant corn again. "

        "text": "Too Much Chocolate W.M. Akers \"They should have never left me alone with you\u0027ll said Keira. \"That was a bad mistake.\" Keira was speaking to a bag of chocolate. It was under her brother\u0027s bed. It was a green bag, and it was almost full. Tyler had not eaten much of his Halloween candy. Now he would never get the chance. Halloween was three days ago. Keira had dressed as a bumblebee. Her brother had gone as a clown. They walked up and down their street and the two next to it. Every house they went to gave them candy. Some gave them lollipops. Some gave them caramel. But Keira\u0027s favorite was the houses that gave them chocolate. Keira loved chocolate. She liked milk chocolate and dark chocolate. She liked white chocolate and coffee-flavored chocolate. She liked chocolate drops, chocolate bars, chocolate oranges and chocolate eggs. She liked chocolate so much that, by the day after Halloween, she had no chocolate left. Tyler ate more slowly. He saved his candy. He ate just one or two pieces at a time. Last year, he made his Halloween candy last all the way to Thanksgiving. That made Keira mad. It was not fair that he could have candy for weeks and weeks, and she had none. That wouldn\u0027t happen this year. Tyler had a friend over. Keira had been watching them. When they went to the backyard to play, she sneaked up the stairs. She opened Tyler\u0027s door. She crept over to his bed. And now she was going to eat his chocolate. \"You\u0027re all mine,\" she said, and laughed a sneaky laugh. She unwrapped the first piece. It was a chocolate-covered cherry. She ate it.  \"Mmmm,\" she said. \"Mmmmmm.\"The next piece was a chocolate egg with marshmallow goo inside. She bit into it, and some of the marshmallow got onto her chin. She ate the rest of it. \"Marshmallow goo is the best,\" she said. Next she ate a chocolate shaped like a flower. Then she ate a chocolate shaped like a bunny rabbit. She ate chocolates with raisins inside, and chocolates with pink fluff, and some chocolates that had nothing inside them at all. Finally, she was going to eat all the chocolate she wanted. After a few minutes of eating, she heard footsteps on the stairs. She tried to get away, but her stomach was too full. Tyler came into the room. He looked mad. \"Hey!\" he said. \"What are you doing with my candy?!\" Keira tried to speak but she was too full. She stood up, and fell back down again. \"Oooooof,\" she groaned. Her face was covered with chocolate. Her hands were sticky. She even had chocolate in her hair. \"I don\u0027t feel so good,\" she said. \"I think I ate too much chocolate.\" Tyler started laughing. He laughed until he fell down too. \"Well!\" he said. \"I think you learned your lesson!\" Keira\u0027s stomach felt like it was going to burst. She felt terrible. She would never steal Tyler\u0027s candy again. "

People who run for office are called candidates. During the weeks before an election is held, candidates describe what they plan to do if they are elected. The candidates make speeches about their ideas. They have discussions with other candidates. They may promise to work to change laws they do not like or to pass new ones. Voters listen to these promises. Then they decide which candidates they think are the best. On Election Day, voters go to a public building, such as a school or a firehouse. They vote by filling out a paper form or, in some places, by using a computer. Long ago, only a small number of people in the United States could vote. Some men were allowed to vote, but women, black people, poor people, and young people could not. Over the years, laws were changed. Now many more people can vote. All voters must be U.S. citizens and at least eighteen years old. They all must have registered, or signed up, to vote. At the end of every Election Day, votes are counted. The winning candidates are announced. Soon, the winners will get their chance to do the things they promised to do. "

Tropical places are warm all year long. The world\u0027s largest rain forest is called the Amazon. It is located in South America. A rain forest is a habitat. A habitat is a place in nature where animals and plants live. Rain forests are full of life. They are home to more than half of the types of plants and animals in the world! Different kinds of animals live in the different parts of the rain forest. Some animals live in the tops of the tallest trees. Those animals include birds, butterflies, and bats. Other creatures live in the tops of shorter trees. You can find monkeys and toucans there. Animals also live in the lower branches. Those creatures include snakes and tree frogs. Finally, most big rain forest animals live on the rain forest floor. Those animals include anteaters, gorillas, and jaguars. "

        "text": "Deep in the woods is a secret tree. Only one boy knows about it. It\u0027s a wishing tree. One day, the boy followed his dog into the woods. They stopped at the tree. \"I wish I could climb this tree!\" the boy said. The leaves began to giggle. \"Hello!\" they said. \"Pleased to meet you!\" \"My name is Noah,\" the boy said. \"What\u0027s yours?\" All the leaves started to talk at once. \"We are the Wishing Tree,\" the leaves said. \"We see good children and give them gifts.\" \"I wish I had one million dollars!\" said Noah. But nothing happened. \"I said I wish I had a million dollars!\" Noah said, louder. \"We heard you the ?rst time,\" said the leaves. \"What good are you, anyway?\" \"very good,\" said the leaves. \"This is a very good tree.\" \"Then give me money!\" Noah demanded. \"We can only give you good things. Things that will make you a better person.\" Well, that didn\u0027t sound like much fun. He thought of a new wish. \"I wish I could fight a dragon!\" he said. \"Do you honestly think we would conjure a dragon?\" asked the leaves. \"I guess not,\" said Noah. \"Well, then, I wish I were brave enough to fight a dragon!\" Suddenly, Noah was standing at the bottom of the tree. \"Wish granted!\" said the leaves. \"Arooo!\" said Peanuts the dog. \"Let\u0027s go!\" said Noah. He and Peanuts ran out of the woods. But Noah didn\u0027t feel very brave. \"Some wishing tree that was! No money! No dragons! What a waste!\" Crack! Suddenly, something hit him in the back of his head. \"Hey, No-Brains!\" someone was shouting. \"Oh no!\" Noah said to Peanuts. \"It\u0027s Mitch the bully!\" Mitch was throwing peanuts at Noah. \"Here are some peanuts for your dumb dog!\" Mitch said. That was the last straw! Neah couldn\u0027t take it anymore. \"Go away, bully!\" he yelled. \"You never hurt dogs!\" \"Aroo!\" howled Peanuts the dog. \"Whatever!\" said Mitch. \"You\u0027re not worth my time.\" Mitch left. \"Yay! He left!\" Noah said. \"Thank you, wishing tree!\" Noah had never told Mitch to go away before. But on that day, he was very brave. Being brave was just like fighting a dragon. Being brave was better than having a million dollars. You see, Noah thought his bravery came from the wishing tree. But the truth is, the tree didn\u0027t grant any wishes. Noah did it all himself. Being brave came from inside. If you could make a wish like Noah, what would you wish for?"

        "text": "A plant starts life as a seed. When that seed grows into a plant, that plant makes new seeds. Those seeds, too, can grow and turn into more new plants. But did you know that not every seed grows into a plant? To become a plant, a seed has to travel. That is because seeds need room to grow. A seed has to be far enough away from other plants so that it gets the sunlight and water it needs. If a seed falls to the ground too close to its parent plant, it may not grow. Of course, wind can spread the seeds for many plants. But some plants depend on animals to move their seeds. Those seeds are called hitchhiker seeds. They travel on something else that moves! Many hitchhiker seeds are prickly. They have tiny rows of hooks. The hooks can stick to fur or feathers. Hitchhiker seeds can travel for miles on an animal\u0027s body. Then they fall off or are removed. If they fall in a place that is good for growing, the seeds will grow into plants, too! "

Please think about how different things are today.\" The class took a ferryboat that chugged past the Statue of Liberty. When they arrived at Ellis Island, Sara noticed that the museum was in a big red-and-white building. Inside, Sara saw old trunks, suitcases, and baskets. \"This is where immigrants had to check their baggage,\" a guide said. \"They had come on long trips aboard very crowded ships. They knew they might never be able to return to their old countries. The museum was filled with photographs and exhibits. Sara saw old-time dresses, boots, and other clothing from many countries. She looked at letters and passports and documents. She and her friends watched a few video interviews. The people being interviewed were proud to have become Americans. Sara also felt proud. Her parents had immigrated to the United States, too. She thought she would like to know more about how her parents came here. \"I am going to interview them when I get home,\" she decided. "

        "text": "Ernest Shackleton was an explorer. One hundred years ago, he led an expedition to Antarctica. Things went wrong, however. As Shackleton and twenty-seven men sailed toward the South Pole, their ship became stuck in ice. The ice would not melt until spring. Shackleton decided that he and his shipmates had to spend the freezing winter months on the ship. But they knew the ice had damaged their ship, and that it would sink in the spring. Shackleton decided that he and his men had to leave the ship. They ended up camping on a sheet of ice. They watched their ship sink, safe for the moment. But Shackleton knew they were still in danger. Soon, the sheet of ice they were living on started to melt. Shackleton ordered his men onto the small lifeboats the big ship carried. They all sailed to a nearby island. The men could not find shelter or life there. They could not stay. Shackleton met his new problem with courage. He and five men sailed in a small lifeboat to another island. They found people there. Shackleton sent a ship to bring back the twenty-two other men. The rescue was successful! After two years at sea, every crewman had been saved. Ernest Shackleton solved the problems his men faced. He took a dangerous trip to save his crew. Today, many people consider him a hero. "

One of the first bicycles was called the hobby horse. It was made of wood! People rode by pushing their feet along on the ground. Later, a bicycle that had pedals and metal tires was invented. It was not comfortable. It was called the boneshaker. Inventors kept working to make bicycles more comfortable. Next, the high wheeler was developed. It had a very big wheel in the front. This bicycle was not easy to ride, because the rider sat high up on the bike. The rider could be badly hurt in a fall. Then bicycles began to have two wheels that were the same size. Those bikes looked more like bicycles today. More than one hundred years ago, bicycles began to have rubber tires filled with air. That was a solution to the problem of a bumpy ride. The new tires made riding smoother. Today, children\u0027s bicycles and racing bikes are popular. People ride bikes to get exercise. Bicycling is safer, too. Now people wear helmets, and bikes have reflectors on them. "

They flap their ears back and forth, trying to push away the heat. But it isn\u0027t enough—they are still too hot. The family of elephants walks around to look for a way to cool down. Macy sees a group of orangutans lazily lying on the branches of a big tree. They don’t even move as the elephants walk past, too hot to do anything. A family of parrots flies by, but all Macy sees is a blur of red, green, and blue. The colorful birds land on a branch nearby, and Macy admires their bright feathers. Then, all of a sudden, Macy spots a loris sleeping on the tree that sits right next to the parrots. Macy gets excited—she never sees lorises because they are only awake at night. The small elephant stops to look at the small, fluffy animal. It has a tiny, round face and big, black eyes. Macy is about to take a step closer when her mom and dad pull her along with their strong trunks, not wanting to wait any longer to cool down. Finally, the three elephants find a big pool of water. They run into it and splash the cool water on each other. Macy feels so much better. She lies down and rolls around. She covers her body in mud. Elephants love to take mud baths. It cools their skin and protects them from bug bites. They all play in the water for a while, and other elephants come to enjoy the mud, too. Then Macy and her parents step out of the water and decide to go and find food. Macy spots a banana tree in the distance. She runs toward the bright yellow fruit. She grabs a bunch with her trunk and munches on the soft bananas. It’s been a good day for Macy—bananas and a mud bath. What more could she ask for? "

In the United States, more than ten million crayons are sold every day. The crayons we use today are made of wax and coloring. They are not very different from the first crayons sold more than 120 years ago. An early box of crayons included eight colors. The colors were red, blue, yellow, green, violet, orange, black, and brown. The box cost five cents. As crayons became more popular, new colors were invented. Crayon makers then decided to sell boxes with forty-eight crayons. Later, companies made boxes of sixty-four crayons. Today, there are all kinds of crayons for sale. You can buy washable crayons, color- changing crayons, glitter crayons, and more. A few years ago, one crayon company asked people to vote for their favorite color. The winner? Blue. About three billion crayons are sold in the United States each year. That is enough to circle the earth at least four times! "

Lily built a high wall to protect the sand castle from the wind. Gavin said he thought the wall would stop people from accidentally stepping on the castle and smashing it. People walked by and said nice things about the sand castle. Lily and Gavin’s mom took a photograph of it. Then she said it was time for lunch. Lily and Gavin ran with their mom to the snack bar. \"We will finish our castle when we get back,” they said. After lunch, the children went back to the beach. But where was the sand castle? Did the wind blow it down? Did someone step on it? Lily and Gavin’s mom explained what had happened. The ocean waves had moved up the beach. The rise and fall of the big waves had pushed water farther up onto the shore and the sand. The water must have washed away their castle. \"Some of our shells are scattered around here,” said Lily. \"We should build another sand castle.” \"Okay,\" Gavin agreed. \"Let’s get started!” "

Water moves up the plant\u0027s stem to the leaves. The stem also supports the plant so it stays up straight. A plant\u0027s leaves do not just take in water, however.

        "text": "Bobby loves doggies. He loves big doggies and small doggies. He loves doggies that are soft and even doggies that aren\u0027t so soft. Bobby loves all doggies, except for mean doggies that bite people, because really, nobody likes mean doggies that bite people. But Bobby doesn\u0027t have his own doggy. He can only look at other people\u0027s doggies and wish he had one for himself, and sometimes at night, after his parents tuck him into his bed and turn off the light, he sighs and thinks to himself about how badly he wants one. Bobby is a good little boy. He doesn\u0027t complain, and he never whines about how he doesn\u0027t have a doggy. But Bobby\u0027s mom and dad know how happy a doggy would make him. One day, Bobby\u0027s parents drive over to the pet store and look at the different doggies for sale. All the doggies are small and young. They are puppies. One puppy has fuzzy white hair with a brown patch over its eye and floppy ears. Another has tall pointy ears and a coat of hair that is red and black. Another still has long, wispy hair that is all white. Bobby\u0027s parents look at each of the puppies. They pick them up and pet them and let them lick their faces. There is one puppy that they haven\u0027t seen, though. This puppy has gray hair with some white in it, and little black eyes. It is in the corner of the puppy pen with its head down, and it is looking out at Bobby\u0027s parents with a cute look on its face. \"What is that puppy\u0027s name?\" Bobby\u0027s father asks. \"That puppy\u0027s name is Lucy,\" says the pet store man. Bobby\u0027s father picks up Lucy. She is very, very soft, and very, very nice. Bobby\u0027s father and mother know that this is the dog for Bobby. They pay for her and take her home with them, and hide her in the bathroom. Bobby comes home from school, takes off his backpack and sits down on a couch in the living room. \"Bobby,\" his mother says. \"How was your day at school?\" \"Oh, it was fine,\" he says. But Bobby\u0027s mother knows that he is secretly wishing he had a doggy. Bobby\u0027s dad quietly opens the bathroom door and scoops Lucy into his arms. He sneaks up behind Bobby and very quietly lowers Lucy onto his lap. Bobby yelps with joy! \"What is her name?!\" he asks his parents. \"Her name is Lucy,\" they say. \"And she is all yours.\" And that\u0027s how Bobby meets his best friend. "

The chickens started squawking. Because of the noise, the man avoided her. The woman was named Harriet Tubman. She was wearing a disguise. In fact, Harriet was an African American woman who was an escaped slave. The man who avoided her was a slaveholder who had once owned her. If he had recognized her, he would have tried to capture her again. Two hundred years ago, many African Americans were held as slaves. Most slaves were in the southern United States. Tubman helped the slaves escape to the North and on to Canada. Many other people also helped. They hid escaping slaves in houses and churches along the way. This system, a group of people who worked to help free slaves , was called the Underground Railroad. Facing danger, Harriet Tubman showed courage every day. Slaveholders knew who she was, and the police wanted to arrest her, but she kept on doing her work. Today, Harriet Tubman is remembered as a brave leader who made the world a better place. "

So how can any two countries work together? They use ambassadors! An ambassador (am-BAS-uh-duhr) is a person sent by one country to  represent it someplace else. Ambassadors move from their home country to live and work in another country. Ambassadors work at offices called embassies. The embassy is usually in a country\u0027s capital city. The ambassador works with a team of people at the embassy. Some ambassadors represent a country at an organization, such as the United Nations. What do ambassadors do? They represent their country\u0027s leaders and people. Ambassadors host and attend events. They may make speeches about their home country. The United States has ambassadors in more than a hundred countries. The American ambassador in Mexico works for cooperation between that country and the United States. He helps officials of the two countries come together with ideas. For example, officials might find ways to improve business between the two countries. Ambassadors work hard to build good feelings between their home countries and their host countries. "

        "metadata": "Grade: 2 Lexile: 580L",
        "text": "Alison couldn\u0027t believe she forgot her phone at home. Now she was lost. She was supposed to meet Molly at Circle Art Supply at 6 am. Molly was in college, studying to become a painter. Today, she was going to teach Alison how to paint as well. In order to do that, they needed to buy some art supplies. They needed paint, brushes, and a canvas. Alison liked to plan ahead. She wanted to pick an aisle to meet in, but Molly refused. \"Can\u0027t we have an alternate plan?\" Alison begged. \"Just in case?\" \"No way! I have my phone, and you have your phone. Just text me when you get to Circle\u0027s. It will be easier that way.\" Alison had to admit, using the phone to find each other did sound like the easier idea at first. But when Alison reached into her backpack to pull out her phone, there was nothing in the pocket but an old piece of gum. Now she was stuck, and not just to the gum! Alison knew Molly had to be somewhere in the store, but where? She sat down to brainstorm. \"If I were a painter, what would I need? What aisle would I go to?\" she asked herself. \"Well, the first thing I would need, I guess, is paint!\" On the first floor of Circle Art Supply was a directory of what items you could find on each floor. Circle was located in New York City, and it was four stories tall. It was easy for someone to get lost inside of it, with the twists and turns of the hallways and stairwells. Alison carefully studied the directory. From the first floor, she could take the stairs to the second. But she couldn\u0027t get to the third floor from the second. Instead, she\u0027d have to take an elevator to the fourth, and walk back down a flight of stairs. That meant the third floor was only accessible by the fourth floor. Alison\u0027s head started to spin. Paint was on the third floor, but she was on the first. This was going to be confusing! She went upstairs, then back down again. But she got lost! Alison walked down an extra flight of stairs and ended up on the second floor. Then she had to start all over again. When Alison finally got to the third floor, she saw Molly standing in the paint aisle trying to call her. \"Where have you been?\" Molly asked, flustered. \"I have been trying to call your phone for twenty minutes!\" \"Well,\" said Alison, \"I guess you could say I\u0027ve been walking around in circles.\" "

I said okay, if he would build something different from what I was making. So my brother made a doghouse and a supermarket. When we finished our projects, we played with them for a while.

Some of the greatest heroes did not just do remarkable things that made them famous. In their everyday lives, they behaved in ways that made people admire their character. Character is a group of qualities that make up who a person is. Heroes are often people with great character. Many people with great character are honest. Honest people tell the truth, even when it is hard to do. Someone with great character may also be compassionate. A compassionate person cares about others and works to help them. A person with great character may also be responsible. Responsible people do things they promised to do. Other people can depend on them. Heroes can combine great actions with great character.

        "text": "Lions, tigers, bears, oh my! All these ferocious animals usually steal the spotlight at circuses. Circuses can be a lot of fun. Usually, there are popcorn, lion tamers, clowns, beautiful acrobats, and more. Even elephants walk across the stage with performers on their backs. But even with all the animals, one of the most exciting parts of the circus is the acrobats. Dressed in colorful costumes, these amazing performers fly over the stage on trapezes. Acrobats have to train for many years to do all of these dangerous stunts. It requires a lot of practice. The trapeze is one of the oldest circus acts around. When acrobats first begin to train, they typically start on the trapeze. Then, they can develop new skills. There are many different types of stunts that professional acrobats can do. Sometimes, performers use big pieces of silk that hang from the ceiling to the floor. They use their leg and arm strength to climb the silks. Then they spin, flip, and twirl with the fabric. They have to wrap the silks around their feet or wrists so that they can support their body. It is a big feat! Acrobats also perform on the lyra, or aerial hoop. A rope hangs a big hoop, like a hula hoop, from the ceiling. Acrobats hang off the hoop to do different tricks. They can flip around the hoop, or climb around it using only their legs or arms. This stunt also requires a lot of body strength. Sometimes, two acrobats use just one hoop at the same time to perform. This is a very hard trick! Some circuses only have acrobats. In New York City, there is one group called Lady Circus. These women are professional acrobats and have been training for years. They put on shows every month that always have a big audience. The acrobats wear very colorful costumes they make themselves. People love their performances! Since Lady Circus is loved so much, the acrobats often perform at other events around the city. But whenever they do perform, they always need high ceilings. They have to hang up their trapezes, silks, and hoops. Even though it is a lot of work, the members of Lady Circus love what they do. Not many other people can say that they fly over a stage on a regular basis! "

Maps include a key, or legend, listing those symbols. The legend tells what each symbol means. Finding places on a map is not always simple. That is why maps use numbers, letters, and lists to make the search easier. Here is an example. Most maps use a grid, which is like a checkerboard. Along one edge of the grid, small letters are spaced evenly. On another side, numbers are printed in the same way. Those maps include a list of places. Next to the name of each place will be a letter and a number, such as \"A7.\" To find that place, you look for \"A\" on the letter side of the map, and \"7\" on the number side. Finally, you locate the area where the letter and the number meet. Nearby, you should find the place you\u0027re looking for! "

The Mississippi begins in the northern U.S. state of Minnesota. The river then goes south for more than two thousand miles to the state of Louisiana. There, the mighty Mississippi empties into the Gulf of Mexico. Native Americans depended on the Mississippi for thousands of years. They were the first people in North America. Someone who is native was born in a place. Native Americans traveled the river by canoe and ate fish that lived in the water. They called the river Misi, zibi, which means \"big river.\" That is where the river got its name. Today, boats bring important items up and down the river daily. But it is more than just a highway for boats. The Mississippi is home to all kinds of animals. More than 250 types of fish and at least fifty kinds of mammals live along the river. The Mississippi also supports millions of people. At least fifty cities rely on the river for their daily water supply. The big river is a very important river! "

Other events occur slowly, such as when rocks are worn down over hundreds of years. Erosion (ih-ROH-jzun) is the name given to that very slow change. Moving water can cause erosion. Have you ever seen waves crash against rocks on the shore? The water can chip off small pieces of rock. As more waves hit the rocks, the pieces become even smaller. Eventually, those pieces may turn into sand. Ice can cause erosion. Some mountains have solid sheets of ice near the top. During warmer weather, a bit of ice melts. Then the sheet of ice may move slowly down the mountain. As the solid ice moves, it scrapes rocks, breaking off pieces. Wind also causes erosion. Wind can blow sand and dirt. It can carry the dirt far away. In some places, strong wind will push sand against rocks. Over a long period of time, the wind wears down those rocks. "

        "text": "The Power of the Earth By Linda Ruggieri Rumble, rumble! Sometimes the earth shakes beneath people\u0027s feet. That shaking is called an earthquake. An earthquake can happen on land or in the ocean. Earthquakes can rattle walls, cause giant waves, and even bring down buildings. Here is why earthquakes happen. Earth is not one solid rock. If you could drill deep into our planet, you would find four layers. The top layer is the crust. Below the crust is the mantle. Under that is the outer core. The deepest layer of Earth is the inner core. The crust and the upper mantle are broken into giant pieces of rocks called tectonic plates. These plates float on top of the mantle like icebergs floating on the ocean. The plates move so slowly, however, that people cannot feel them moving. The plates sometimes move apart or slide past each other. One plate can even sink beneath another. But occasionally the edges of the plates get stuck. When that happens, pressure builds. Eventually, the pressure releases enough energy for the plates to break loose. A relatively small amount of energy is usually required for the plates to break loose, and the nearby ground shakesjust a little. Sometimes, however, a lot of energy is needed. Then the result is a big and dangerous earthquake! "

As they got out of the car, Layla saw her friends. \"Let\u0027s go into the water!\" she called. Layla always had fun at the park in the summer. Families had picnics. The kids played and went swimming in the lake. In the spring, Layla\u0027s dad took her fishing at the lake. They went early in the morning. The lake water was still. It was different from the river, which had water that rushed by. One morning in the fall, the lake had fog over it. Layla\u0027s dad told her how fog formed. He said hot summer days had warmed the water. Then cooler fall air moved over the lake\u0027s warm water. The water vapor, or the gas form of water, in the air became cool. That caused condensation. It changed the gas into tiny drops of water. We can see those drops of water hang in the air as fog. Layla loved winter at the park, too. The cold temperatures made the lake freeze. When the ice was thick and safe, people went ice, skating. The lake changed from season to season. But it was always a place to have fun! "

I can tell you how we solve this problem.\" She set the girls down on the bed. \"Anna,\" said Maria, \"you took Olivia\u0027s shirt without asking, right?\" \"I guess so,\" said Anna. \"You did. And then you got it stained at school,\" said Maria. \"You didn\u0027t stain the shirt, but it is your responsibility because you took it.\" Anna nodded. \"And Olivia,\" said Maria, \"yelling at your sister and throwing her clothes won\u0027t help. The best way for you to speak to your sister is to be calm and talk about what is wrong.\" Olivia nodded. \"So go ahead and talk to each other calmly,\" Maria said. Olivia turned to Anna. \"I am sorry I threw your clothes around,\" she said. \"I was mad because of the shirt. I don\u0027t like it when you take my things without asking. I\u0027ll help you put it all away.\" \"And lam sorry that I took the shirt,\" said Anna. \"I like it, but I should have asked you.\" \"See?\" said Maria. \"Isn\u0027t it better that you spoke about it?\" The girls nodded. Maria smiled. \"Okay, so I\u0027ll put this shirt into the washing machine. Let\u0027s see if we can get this stain out. The three of us can eat some ice cream while we wait.\" \"Thank you, Maria,\" said Olivia. \"We love it when you babysit!\" "

        "text": "We live on a wet planet. In fact, most of the surface of Earth is covered with water. Oceans are the largest bodies of water on Earth. You probably know that ocean water is salty. Do you know why? It is mainly because rain brings salt from the land and into the ocean! Here is how that happens: Rain falls onto rocks. The rainwater breaks down salt and minerals from the rocks. The water mixes with the salt and minerals. Then it flows into the oceans. Scientists have discovered two other sources of salty ocean water. Some salt comes from underwater volcanoes. Other salt spurts from heated vents on the ocean floor. Most ocean salt, however, starts on land. Lakes are large bodies of water. They are surrounded by land. Lakes usually have fresh water, but some lakes have salt water. The Great Salt Lake in Utah is a saltwater lake. Lake water does not move from place to place. Rivers are filled with freshwater that moves from one place to another. The water in rivers comes mostly from rain. Rivers usually flow into oceans. Streams and creeks are also bodies of moving fresh water. They are smaller than rivers. Streams and creeks can come together and form larger streams or rivers. "

        "text": "People have been trying to build a flying car for a long time. So far, no one has been able to get a car off the ground safely. But engineers keep trying! One problem is that flying cars need wings. The wings must be designed so they will not stick out into other lanes of the road. Engineers are looking for solutions to that problem. Two kinds of flying cars are being developed that may solve the problem. One type is called the Transition. It has rotating blades that spin and lift the car. Those blades fold flat against the sides when the car is on the ground. Another kind is named the Skycar. It has large propellers. These propeller wings fold up and can be packed in the car\u0027s trunk. Flying cars will not just fly up from the road. They will have to take off from an airport runway. Still, some people are eager to have one of their own. Nobody is sure when flying cars will be available, but one company already has a hundred customers waiting for one. So fasten your seat belts, and get ready for takeoff. Someday, cars may be on the road and in the air! "

A few years ago, people living in the Tohoku region of Japan saw something strange. Giant ocean waves were coming toward them. When the waves reached the beach, they did not stop. Streets and homes were flooded. Giant waves like those are known as tsunamis (soo-NAH-MEESS). Tsunami is a Japanese word that means \"harbor wave.\" What causes a tsunami? An earthquake occurs in the ocean. The land below the water shakes. That causes water to swell into giant waves. The waves travel quickly across the ocean. The tsunami that hit Tohoku started as an earthquake in the ocean eighty miles away. The quake was very strong. The tsunami waves it created kept coming for hours. The waves destroyed ships, cars, and many buildings. Scientists are studying the events of the Tohoku tsunami. The scientists hope to learn things that will make people safer the next time a tsunami happens. "

Martin wanted to build a new birdhouse. The last one he had built fell apart after one windy night. This time, Martin knew he had to make a stronger birdhouse. He just was not sure how to do that. Martin asked his friend Diego for help. Diego was good at building things. Martin explained his idea about the birdhouse, but Diego was confused. So Martin drew a picture to show what he was thinking. Diego looked at the sketch carefully. \"Why does the hole for the bird need to be so big?\" he asked Martin. \"It doesn\u0027t,\" said Martin. \"You\u0027re right.\" Diego also suggested that the birdhouse could be attached to the tree in a much better way. He drew another picture to show Martin how that attachment would work. After talking a while longer, Martin and Diego drew one more sketch. Then they began building the birdhouse together. \"We are a good team,\" Martin told Diego. \"I think your ideas will make my birdhouse stronger!\" "

The people who wrote the Constitution did not want one person or group to have too much power. That was why they divided the government into three parts, known as branches. The branches are the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. Each branch has its own responsibilities. Any branch can change decisions made by the other two branches. The legislative branch is called the United States Congress. It is made up of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Voters in each state elect their U.S. representatives and senators. Those men and women go to Washington, D.C., to pass laws. The executive branch has the power to carry out the laws. It includes the president, the vice president, and their group of advisers called the cabinet. Every four years, Americans vote to elect a president and a vice president. The judicial branch makes sure laws are written and followed correctly. This branch includes the United States Supreme Court. Nine justices serve on the Supreme Court. The president appoints the justices, and the Senate approves them. The justices\u0027 job is to decide important questions about the country\u0027s laws. "

The first tooth cleaners were thin twigs called chew sticks. The sticks were fuzzy at one end. A person rubbed the chew stick against his or her teeth to keep them clean. About two hundred years ago, William Addis invented something closer to today’s toothbrush. He collected thick animal hairs, called bristles. He attached the hairs to a handle made from animal bone. Addis found that lots of customers wanted his invention. People still wanted to improve the tooth cleaner, however. Animal hairs did not feel great against human teeth! Finally, man-made bristles were created. They were made out of nylon. Then plastic was used for handles. Now toothbrushes could be made quickly and cheaply. Millions were sold. About fifty years ago, the electric toothbrush was invented. It does a great job of cleaning teeth. Today, we have toothbrushes with soft or hard bristles. There are special sizes for adults, children, and babies. The toothbrush has come a long way since chew sticks. Who knows what kind of toothbrush will be invented in the future? "

Today, I had to use the computer to do my homework. First, I went on the Internet to find out about how bears live in the winter. Then I typed up a report. Grandma said, \"Such progress!” I asked her what she had meant. She told me about how computers have changed everything. \"Computers have even changed the way kids do homework,” she said. Grandma told me that when she was a girl, people did not have computers at home. \"Well, how did you look up information?” | asked Grandma. She told me that she went to the library and read books about the information she needed to learn. If she needed help with homework, she asked her mother. Her mom was home every day. When my parents come home, I will be excited to tell them what Grandma said. Things sure have changed since Grandma was a girl! "

Elizabeth applied to many medical schools in the United States, but they would not take her. These schools were only allowing men to study medicine. Finally, Elizabeth found a school that let her in.

She and her sister opened a clinic for women and children in New York City. They gave medical care to the poor. Dr. Blackwell also opened a medical college for women.

But when your grandparents were children, most people watching TV at home could not have seen any of those colors. Television programs were broadcast in black-and-white only. Television sets that could broadcast in color have been around for a long time. An engineer named John Logie Baird invented a color TV set in the 1930s.For many years, people worked to improve how color televisions worked. Over time, companies found ways to make the picture clearer. The improvements also meant that a user could turn a dial to add just the right amount of color to the picture.By the late 1960s, many people were buying color televisions. Soon, most TV shows were being broadcast in color, and most people in the U.S. had color TV sets. Today, it’s unusual to find any television show that is still broadcast in black- and-white. Now the world of television is full of color! "

This old man was not a human being, however. He was a rock formation on a mountainside! To many people, five huge granite rocks in the White Mountains looked like the side, or pro?le, of a man’s face. Some people called him Great Stone Face. The Old Man of the Mountain was discovered about two hundred years ago. For a very long time, Great Stone Face was one of the best-known places in New Hampshire. Then, sometime during the night of May 3, 2003, the rocks that made up the old man’s face fell apart. Millions of years of rain, snow, and wind had worn away parts of the rocks. Finally, those rocks collapsed. Now Great Stone Face was damaged. It no longer looked like a man’s profile. Many people were sad that the Old Man of the Mountain would never be the same. But now visitors look north to another rock formation. This time, they see what looks like the barrel of a cannon sticking out from a fortress. "

It eventually covered thirty nearby houses with mud and dirt. Many people were hurt. Landslide is the word many people use to describe this kind of emergency. This landslide happened when very heavy rains soaked the ground near Oso. At the beginning of any muddy landslide, wet ground breaks loose. As the mud moves, it may rip bushes, boulders, trees, and other things out of the ground. Landslides can cause serious damage. A big landslide could bury homes and badly injure people in its path. Landslides can also dump huge amounts of wet dirt onto roads and highways. This added enormous weight could wreck cars and might even cause the road to collapse. If a landslide happens near an area that includes buildings, it could break water lines, gas lines, or electrical lines. That kind of damage could also start fires. Scientists are trying to figure out how to help people be safe in areas where landslides occur. The best thing, experts say, is to have a plan for what to do if this kind of moving-earth emergency happens. "

        "text": "Joanna said, \"Cindy is going to Brazil next Friday.” Mona and Lydia had come to her house for a play date. Her big sister, Beth, was with them too. Cindy hadn’t come yet. Her mother wanted her to get started on packing. They were going to Salvador on the northeast coast of Brazil. Cindy’s father had been talking about it for six months. But the girls thought it wouldn’t happen. And now she was going. They could not stop her. Cindy was very sad when she came. She said she didn’t want to go. She didn’t even know where Salvador was. But she knew it was very far and she wouldn’t see her friends every day. How would she get there? How would she take all her books and toys, and clothes? And she could not take her house. Or her dog Biscuit. Where would she live? Cindy wanted to hide in Joanna’s house, so her parents couldn’t take her away. But wouldn’t they find her sometime? How would Cindy find out more about what it would be like? \"It’s easy. There are a number of ways to solve problems like this. We can use designs, sketches, or physical models to figure it out,” said Beth. Joanna took the atlas out. It was a book with many maps. Beth helped them find Salvador: \"See Cindy! Here we are—in North America. And Salvador is in Brazil; in South America.” \"It’s not so far,” Cindy said, looking at the map. \"No, it isn’t,” Mona added. \"And look here, Sao Paulo is in Brazil too! They have a pancake festival there every year in the summer.” Cindy was excited now. \"I love pancakes!” Draw a Sketch. Lydia took out a sketch pad and some pencils, and gave them to Cindy. \"Now imagine,” she said to her. \"You will be living in a new house. Isn’t that wonderful?” Joanna said, \"Let’s see how we want your new home to be.” The girls started drawing. \"Well, that’s what people do before they build a new house!” said Beth. They drew many rooms: for Cindy’s books, her clothes, and her new dog (who would also be called Biscuit). Cindy looked at the drawing. She decided to take it home for her parents. They needn’t worry about the new house now. She had a plan! Design a Model. \"But how will I get there? And will I be able to take all my things?” The girls knew she would be going in an airplane. But none of them had ever traveled in one. Does a plane have wings? How does it fly? Will it carry all of Cindy’s things too? Now Beth gave them each a colored origami paper. They made their own airplanes! As they were doing that, Beth explained to them how airplanes worked: where the engine was, where the pilot sat, and where Cindy’s books and toys would be kept. They saw the wings—just like a bird’s! They flew them all around the room. Cindy would be flying too! All the way to Salvador. \"Now wouldn’t that be fun?” Lydia asked. Cindy could imagine Sao Paulo, the pancakes, the plane, and another Biscuit. She was finally excited! Just then, Joanna’s mother walked in with the phone. Cindy’s father wanted to know when he could pick her up. “Now!” she said. "

        "text": "It\u0027s a hot summer\u0027s day, and Clara is outside on her back porch drinking lemonade. Her mom is in the backyard cutting the grass with a lawn mower. The lawn mower is loud, and Clara wishes her mom would play with her instead. But her mom says because it\u0027s been sunny and then rainy and then sunny again, the grass has had everything it needs to grow. Now it is very long and has to be cut. Suddenly, the lawn mower turns off. Clara\u0027s mom looks upset. Clara wonders what is wrong. Her mom bends over and picks something up out of the grass, and walks over to the porch. Clara\u0027s mom has a turtle in her hand! The turtle is small, and as Clara looks closer, she sees that one leg is at an odd angle. \"I think I broke its leg,\" Clara\u0027s mom says. \"I\u0027m really very sorry. Will you help me nurse it back to health?\" Clara feels bad for the little turtle. Turtles move slowly, so it probably could not run away when it saw the lawn mower coming. And Clara\u0027s mom could not see the turtle in the long grass! It was a mistake, but Clara and her mom will make it right. Clara names the turtle Phillip. Clara and her mom take Phillip the turtle to the veterinarian. The vet takes an x- ray of Phillip\u0027s leg, and confirms that it is broken. Phillip the turtle gets a little splint and bandage for his broken leg. The vet tells Clara that Phillip needs plants to eat and water to drink, plus a place to live. Clara and her mom buy a small tank at the pet store on the way home for the turtle to recuperate in. At home, Clara takes good care of Phillip the turtle. She puts water and rocks in the tank. She brings him fruit and leaves to eat, and keeps his water bowl clean. Phillip seems to be in a better mood. After eight weeks, Clara and her mom take Phillip back to the vet, who says that his leg is healed. Clara is both happy and sad. Happy because Phillip is better, but sad because she has to let him go now. When Clara gets home, she kisses Phillip\u0027s shell, says goodbye, and lets him go in the backyard. Clara will always remember Phillip. "

They capture important events, such as birthday parties or weddings, or they show beautiful places. Years later, people may look at these special photos to remember the past. Long ago, however, cameras had not been invented yet. How did people back then record important moments? Some people told stories about old times. Others wrote down what they remembered. Some people made special drawings to help them recall important moments. Among those people were Native Americans of the Lakota tribe. Every year, Lakota leaders decided which event was most important. A Lakota artist was then asked to draw a special picture of that event. Because each year\u0027s picture was decided on during the winter, the drawings became known as winter counts. For a long time, winter counts were drawn on animal skins. Later, the drawings were done on paper. The pictures told the history of the tribe. Each year, the newest winter count was added to the Lakota collection of pictures from earlier times. That helped people keep track of the years. Today, winter counts are important records of the Lakota\u0027s past. "

Maybe someone related to you moved to America long ago. That person might have arrived at Ellis Island. It is an island in New York City\u0027s harbor. Long ago, Ellis Island was the first stop in the United States for many newcomers. These newcomers were called immigrants. From 1892 to 1924, more than twelve million immigrants came through Ellis Island. Nearly all immigrants came to America by ship. They were examined at Ellis Island before they were allowed to enter the United States. Many people who entered the United States through Ellis Island nicknamed it \"The Island of Hope.\" But not everyone was allowed into the United States. Some people were turned away. They gave Ellis Island another, sadder nickname: \"The Island of Tears.\" Today, millions of people come to the United States on airplanes. Ellis Island stopped accepting immigrants many years ago. The island is now home to a museum. It has a collection that tells the story of immigration. The museum shows immigrants\u0027 photographs, letters, documents, clothing, and much more. At the museum\u0027s American Family Immigration History Center, you can use a computer to see if anyone in your family came through Ellis Island. "

I remembered that Grandpa told me that plants depend on water and sunlight to grow. So I put the pot in a sunny spot by the window, and I added some water. I checked on my plant every day. When the soil felt dry, I added more water. Today, I saw a tiny stem. The plant is growing! Over the next few weeks, more stems and leaves will grow. Then flowers will grow, too. What am I most excited about? I cannot wait to eat the beans! I think they will taste even better because I grew them myself. "

        "text": "A pond is a body of fresh water. It is usually smaller than a lake. Ponds are not as deep as lakes are. Water in a river or a stream moves, but pond water stays still. A pond is a habitat. A habitat is a place in nature where animals and plants live. Ponds are home to lots of living things. Many animals live in, above, or near ponds. Fish, turtles, and snails live in the water. Ducks and other birds live above the water. Other animals live near ponds. Those animals include frogs, beavers, and muskrats. Plants live in ponds, too. Cattails and algae are two kinds of plants often found in ponds. Another plant that lives in ponds is the water lily. Its roots go to the bottom of the pond. Its wide leaves float on top of the water. "

Carolina\u0027s books are thirty-two pages long. After she finishes writing a story, my aunt makes a storyboard. A storyboard is like a map to help the people who are putting the book together. My aunt draws her storyboard on one big piece of paper. The paper is covered with little boxes that stand for pages in the book. Under each box is a page number. Inside the boxes are small drawings. Each drawing shows what Carolina wants to see on that page. Aunt Carolina gives her storyboard to Joe. The sketches help communicate her ideas. After Joe looks at the storyboard, he talks to Carolina about the story. If they agree to change something, they can. They add those changes to the storyboard. When the storyboard is done, Carolina and Joe put the book together. Joe draws pictures based on the sketches. He also adds color. Sometimes, Carolina has to add or subtract words on a page. When the book is finished, it is printed. My aunt always gives me a copy. I love her books! "

        "text": "Last week, Kaitlyn\u0027s refrigerator stopped working. When Kaitlyn and her sister Lydia came home from school, they found pink water all over the floor. \"Why on earth is this water pink?\" Kaitlyn asked. \"Because it\u0027s not water!\" Lydia said. \"It\u0027s strawberry ice cream!\" \"Oh no!\" Kaitlyn cried. Everything in the freezer had melted. Kaitlyn and Lydia always had ice cream or a Popsicle for dessert. Now dessert was liquid. This was a disaster! Quietly, Kaitlyn opened a Popsicle and dumped orange liquid into a cup. When no one was looking, she drank it. I won\u0027t tell on you,\" Lydia said. Then, she secretly drank a Popsicle, too. A week later, the new refrigerator arrived. It was big and silver. One of the doors had a special compartment to dispense ice. The best part about the new refrigerator wasn\u0027t the ice. It was the box it came in. The box was the size of a mansion. Later, Kaitlyn\u0027s friends Lainey and Michael came by to see the box. Lydia was there, too. \"Let\u0027s make a house out of it,\" said Lainey. \"No, let\u0027s make a fort,\" suggested Michael. \"Wait!\" said Kaitlyn. \"It\u0027s my refrigerator box. We should make a spaceship.\" \"Hey! It\u0027s my box, too!\" said little sister Lydia. \"Just because I\u0027m only six doesn\u0027t mean I don\u0027t get a vote!\" Everyone stared at Lydia. They waited. What would her vote be? \"Well, vote then!\" \"I vote...\" she paused. \"I vote...\" \"Come on, Lydia!\" Everyone was getting impatient. Lydia stared at the ceiling. She got nervous when people stared at her. Finally, she made up her mind. \"I vote...to make a bus!\" she said. When Michael and Lainey heard this, they changed their minds. \"Yeah, we want a bus too!\" Now they had three votes for a bus but only one vote for a spaceship. The bus had the majority vote. \"Fine. How should we make this bus, smarty pants?\" asked Kaitlyn. \"We could cut holes in the box for windows,\" said Michael. \"I\u0027m not allowed to use sharp scissors by myself,\" said Kaitlyn. \"We could use stickers,\" said Lydia. \"Where would we get enough stickers from?\" Kaitlyn asked. \"I have five stickers,\" Lydia said. \"No way! The box is huge. We\u0027ll need hundreds!\" said Kaitlyn. \"Sometimes you\u0027re so...six years old!\" Lydia felt angry. Just because she was six didn\u0027t mean her ideas were bad! \"Wait!\" Lydia said. \"Let\u0027s paint the box instead.\" \"That\u0027s a great idea!\" said Michael and Lainey. Kaitlyn didn\u0027t want to admit this was a good idea. \"Fine! Everybody go get some paint,\" she said. Kaitlyn always wanted to get her way. Michael came back with finger paint. Lydia came back with watercolor paint. Lainey brought a box of acrylic craft paint. Poor Kaitlyn could only find crayons. \"What do we do now?\" Lainey asked. \"We\u0027ve got so many different kinds of paint.\" \"And crayons,\" said Kaitlyn, depressed that she couldn\u0027t find paint. \"Which will work the best?\" Michael asked. \"I think we just have to experiment,\" Lydia suggested. Kaitlyn didn\u0027t want to admit her sister had a good idea. \"I don\u0027t know about that,\" Kaitlyn said. \"But that\u0027s the best idea,\" said Michael. \"Yes,\" Lainey agreed. \"We need to try each kind of paint. Then we can see what works best.\" \"Whatever,\" said Kaitlyn. \"She\u0027s only six.\" Dad helped bring the refrigerator box into the backyard. Then he spread a large piece of plastic on the grass. This kind of plastic is called a tarp. Dad said it would stop them from getting paint on the grass. \"The grass is already green,\" he said. \"We don\u0027t need to paint it purple, too.\" Each friend chose a section of the box. They painted on it for the next 15 minutes. When they finished painting, they looked at all the sections. Together, they decided which paint worked best. Here\u0027s what they saw: The watercolor paint was too light. The crayons were too thick. The finger paint was too messy. \"The acrylic paint worked the best,\" Kaitlyn said. \"Sure did!\" everyone agreed. The four friends painted the refrigerator box to look like a bus. It took them all afternoon. They painted windows and doors. They even painted some kids inside the bus. \"It\u0027s so colorful!\" said Lydia. \"It\u0027s beautiful!\" Kaitlyn agreed. When they finished, Lydia looked to see what her sister had painted. On the back of the bus, Kaitlyn had painted a heart. It said: \"I love you, little sister.\" Lydia couldn\u0027t believe her eyes. \"I love you, too!\" she said. \"For a six-year-old, you\u0027re not so bad.\" \"All aboard the Lydia Express!\" everyone said. \"It was her idea to make a bus!\" They all climbed into the colorful bus. They drove wherever they felt like going. When they returned home, they had ice cream from the brand new refrigerator. "

Big and strong and full of might, the mommy bird is a capable hunter. She is a hawk with sharp eyes and big talons. Talons are bird claws. The nest is up high in a towering oak tree. The chicks are hungry. The mommy bird takes off into the sky to find food. She soars through the air. The sun is out. There are no clouds, and the wind is blowing cool. The mommy bird enjoys the free feeling of flying. Down below on the ground she spots a little mouse. She makes her move. With incredible speed, she dips her wings and begins shooting toward the ground. She pounces on the mouse and eats it up. Now she has food and can feed her babies. The mommy bird flies back to the nest. Her chicks are chirping away, ready to be fed. Their feathers are light and fluffy, and their little bird faces are cute. The mommy bird regurgitates the mouse that she ate. Regurgitate is another way of saying that she brings the food she swallowed back up to her mouth. The mommy bird opens her mouth and the little chicks peck at it, eating away and getting their fill. The mommy bird knows she has done her job. This is how the mommy bird ensures that her young ones will grow up to be big and strong. This is how she helps them survive. "

        "text": "Have you ever swapped sandwiches with a friend at lunchtime? Trade is the name we give to any exchange of one thing for something else. Trading can take place between people, companies, and countries. Trade involves services, money, and goods. Maybe you mowed your neighbor\u0027s lawn and she paid you. That was trading a service for money. Or maybe you traded your scooter for a friend\u0027s video game. That was trading goods. People and countries may trade because they have too much of one thing and need something else. For example, in some countries, people grow a lot of rice. They produce more than they need for themselves. That allows them to sell their rice to other countries. The buyers of the rice send money to the sellers. The sellers might use that money to buy tools and other goods. Trade allows people to sell, buy, or exchange goods and services to get what they need. "

        "text": "A windmill is a machine that runs on the power of the wind. Long ago, farmers used windmills to pump water and make flour. Each windmill had blades at the top of a tower. When the wind blew, its power made the blades spin. The spinning blades turned a pole inside the tower. The pole then ran a water pump or moved a stone that ground, or mashed, grain into little pieces. Today, people have learned how to get much more power from the wind. We have made a lot of progress! Now we have wind turbines. These turbines are modern windmills. Wind turbines have large blades at the top of a high pole. The blades spin quickly when the wind blows. When the blades spin, they power a generator. That is a machine that makes electricity. Electricity brings light and power to homes and businesses. Wind turbines are often built in a group in many rows. That group is called a wind farm. Wind farms produce a large amount of electricity. "

        "text": "Today, nearly all television programs are broadcast in color. If you turn on a baseball game, you can see that the grass on the field is green, or that the pitcher has a blue cap on. But when your grandparents were children, most people watching TV at home could not have seen any of those colors. Television  programs were broadcast in black-and-white only. Television sets that could broadcast in color have been around for a long time. An engineer named John Logie Baird invented a color TV set in the 1930s. But the picture on Baird\u0027s TV flickered, and was not clear. Companies would not sell a TV that was not good quality. For many years, people worked to improve how color televisions worked. Over time, companies found ways to make the picture clearer. The improvements also meant that a user could turn a dial to add just the right amount of color to the picture. By the late 1960s, many people were buying color televisions. Soon, most TV shows were being broadcast in color, and most people in the U.S. had color TV sets. Today, it\u0027s unusual to find any television show that is still broadcast in black- and-white. Now the world of television is full of color!\""

The Everglades is an area of beautiful wetlands in southern Florida. Manv kinds of waterbirds, such as wood storks, and mammals, such as bobcats, live in the Everglades. A number of reptiles live there, too. In fact, southern Florida is the only place in the world where alligators and crocodiles live side by side. The Everglades area is an ecosystem. Ecosystems are places where living things exist with nonliving things, such as water and soil. Everything in an ecosystem affects everything else. If something new is brought into the ecosystem, it may cause problems. Change caused by humans created big problems in the Everglades. As more people moved to Florida, new homes and businesses were needed. Because the Everglades area was large and beautiful, people thought it might be a good place to build. The ground, however, was too wet. In order to build homes, people drained water from some of the wet ground. Ta king water out of the Everglades caused many problems. Animals that ate water plants or small fish had a hard time finding food. The wood stork and other waterbirds began dying. People worried that this special place would be lost forever. Today, a portion of the Everglades is a national park. The law protects animals and plants there. Homes and businesses cannot be built inside Everglades National Park. Because it is now protected as a park, part of the Everglades will be beautiful wetlands for many years to come. "

Cortes Bank is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and about 100 miles from any land. The west coast is home to many large waves. Cortes Bank is the site of some of the largest and fastest waves in the world. The bank is a rugged, rocky, undersea ridge about 100 miles west of San Diego, California. In some places, the ridge is only 3 feet below the ocean\u0027s surface. Strong winds from winter storms sweep across the ocean\u0027s surface. The winds push the water, causing huge waves to form when the water rushes over Cortes Bank. Because there is no land to slow the water after the bank, the waves stay large. According to weather experts, Cortes Bank produces waves that are more than 70 feet high. That\u0027s as tall as a seven, story building! Some waves move at more than 30 miles per hour. Cortes Bank is considered one of the hardest places to surf in the world."
