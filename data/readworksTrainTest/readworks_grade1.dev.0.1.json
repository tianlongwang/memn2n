        "text": " What do you hear? You may hear people talking. You may hear a car or the wind or music. Your ears help you hear those sounds. Sound travels in waves. The waves go into your outer ear. That is the part you see. Inside your ear, sound waves go through a tiny tunnel. It is called the ear canal. Those waves hit stretched-out pieces of skin called eardrums. The eard ru ms vibrate. That means they shake back and forth. Your inner ear turns those vibrations into a signal. That signal goes to your brain. The brain understands that the signal is a sound. What is the result? You hear something! "

Summer starts in the northern half of Earth around June 21. At that time, it is winter in the southern part of Earth. That is because the Earth\u0027s southern half is tilted away from the sun. "

        "text": "Long ago, Native Americans wore shoes made of soft leather. These shoes were known as moccasins (MAH-kuh-suhns). The leather was from the skin of a deer or a moose. Members of the tribe dried the animal skin, turning it into leather. Then the members shaped the leather to cover their feet. Each tribe had its own decorations for moccasins. Some tribes used beads. In other tribes, members painted symbols onto the animal skins. Some moccasins had hard bottoms. They were good for walking on sharp stones or prickly cacti. Moccasins with soft bottoms were best for walking in leaves. "

        "text": "Why Do We Have Winter? By Rachelle Kreisman Winter starts on the shortest day of the year. We call that day the winter solstice. Winter days are colder. There is less sunshine. Some places get snow and ice. People spend more time indoors. Why do we have winter? Earth tilts as it travels around the sun. When the northern half of Earth tilts away from the sun, that part of Earth has winter. Winter starts in the northern half of Earth around December 21. At the same time, it is summer in southern half of Earth. That is because the Earth\u0027s southern half is tilted toward the sun. "

When it is dark, you see the moon shining in the sky. But we know that the moon does not make its own light. Moonlight is really light from the sun. The moon reflects the sunlight. When something is reflected, it is thrown back. The sun\u0027s light is thrown back to Earth. That makes the moon look as if it has its own light. What you are really seeing is the reflection of the sun\u0027s light. "

Lightning can go from cloud to cloud. It can also strike the ground. When that happens, lightning takes the shortest path. It hits tall objects. It may hit buildings or trees. It may also hit people. Lightning is really hot. When it travels, it heats up the air. The very hot air makes a loud noise. That is the thunder you hear. People see lightning before they hear thunder. Why? Light travels more quickly than sound. "

        "text": "Butterflies are beautiful insects. You often see them around colorful flowers. A butterfly\u0027s life begins in a special way. First, a mother butterfly lays an egg on a leaf. A caterpillar hatches from the egg. The caterpillar eats leaves and grows bigger. Next, the caterpillar spins a covering around itself. The covering is called a chrysalis (KRIS-a-liss). Inside the chrysalis, the caterpillar slowly changes. The insect\u0027s wings, legs, and antennae begin to form. About two weeks later, a new creature pops out of the chrysalis. It has become a butterfly! The butterfly flutters its wings and flies away. "
