##Implemented MemN2n for multiple choices questions
The 'mc' prefix are the multiple choices version of the model

The data are from readworks and mctest. 

I also implemented linear start as documented in the original paper.

# MemN2N

Implementation of [End-To-End Memory Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08895) with sklearn-like interface using Tensorflow. Tasks are from the [bAbl](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05698) dataset.

This is a fork of the original repository https://github.com/domluna/memn2n written by Dominique Luna.

Changes from the original implementation include -
1. L2 regularizations for weight matrices
2. Jaccard similarity for sentence selection to form memories
3. Per task early stopping during joint training
4. Web demo (see below)

## Demo
We added a web demo allowing us to test the model and visualize the memory probabilities in each hop (episode). Below is an example that demonstrate it -
